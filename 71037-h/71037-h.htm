THE GAMBLERS
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
IS PURELY PERSONAL
</h3>

<p>
No.  I dare not reveal anything here, lest I may be
misjudged.
</p>

<p>
The narrative is, to say the least, a strange one;
so strange, indeed, that had I not been one of the
actual persons concerned in it I would never have
believed such things were possible.
</p>

<p>
Yet these chapters of an eventful personal
history, remarkable though they may appear,
nevertheless form an unusual story&mdash;a combination
of circumstances which will be found startling and
curious, idyllic and tragic.
</p>

<p>
Reader, I would confess all, if I dared, but each
of us has a skeleton in the cupboard, both you and
I, for alas! I am no exception to the general rule
prevailing among women.
</p>

<p>
If compelled by a natural instinct to suppress
one single fact, I may add that it has little or nothing
to do with the circumstances here related.  It
concerns only myself, and no woman cares to supply
food for gossips at her own expense.
</p>

<p>
To be brief, it is my intention to narrate plainly
and straightforwardly what occurred, while hoping
that all who read may approach my story with a
perfectly open mind, and afterwards judge me fairly,
impartially, and without the prejudice likely to be
entertained against one whose shortcomings are
many, and whose actions have perhaps not always
been tempered by wisdom.
</p>

<p>
My name is Carmela Rosselli.  I am English,
of Italian extraction, five-and-twenty years of age,
and for many years&mdash;yes, I confess it freely&mdash;I have
been utterly world-weary.  I am an only child.
My mother, one of the Yorkshire Burnetts, married
Romolo Annibale, Marchese Rosselli, an impecunious
member of the Florentine aristocracy, and after
a childhood passed in Venice I was sent to the
Convent of San Paolo della Croce, in the Val d'Ema,
near Florence, to obtain my education.  My
mother's money enabled the Marchese to live in the
reckless style customary to a gentleman of the
Tuscan nobility; but, unfortunately for me, both
my parents died when I was fifteen, and left me
in the care of a second cousin, a woman but a few
years older than myself&mdash;kind-hearted, everything
that was most English and womanly, and in all
respects truly devoted to me.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that at the age of eighteen I received
the maternal kiss of the grave-eyed Mother Superior,
Suor Maria, and of all the good sisters in turn,
and then travelled to London, accompanied by my
guardian, Ulrica Yorke.
</p>

<p>
Like myself, Ulrica was wealthy; and because
she was very smart and good-looking she did not
want for admirers.  We lived together at Queen's
Gate for several years, amid that society which circles
around Kensington Church, until one rather dull
afternoon in autumn Ulrica made a most welcome
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"Carmela, I am ruined, morally and physically.
I feel that I want a complete change."
</p>

<p>
I suggested Biarritz or Davos for the winter,
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered.  "I feel that I must build
up my constitution as well as my spirits.  The
gayer Continent is the only place&mdash;say Paris for
a month, Monte Carlo for January, then Rome till
after Easter."
</p>

<p>
"To Monte Carlo!" I gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" she inquired.  "You have money,
and we may just as well go abroad for a year to
enjoy ourselves as vegetate here."
</p>

<p>
"You are tired of Guy?" I observed.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her well-formed shoulders, pursed
her lips, and contemplated her rings.
</p>

<p>
"He has become a little too serious," she said
simply.
</p>

<p>
"And you want to escape him?" I remarked.
"Do you know, Ulrica, I believe he really loves
you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and if he does?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you told me, only a couple of months
ago, that he was the best-looking man in London,
and that you had utterly lost your heart to him."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I've lost it so many times that I begin to
believe I don't nowadays possess that very useful
portion of the human anatomy.  But," she added,
"you pity him, eh?  My dear Carmela, you should
never pity a man.  Not one of them is really
worth sympathy.  Nineteen out of every twenty
are ready to declare love to any good-looking
woman with money.  Remember your dearest
Ernest."
</p>

<p>
Mention of that name caused me a twinge.
</p>

<p>
"I have forgotten him!" I cried hotly.  "I
have forgiven&mdash;all that belongs to the past."
</p>

<p>
She laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"And you will go on the Continent with me?"
she asked.  "You will go to commence life afresh.
What a funny thing life is, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
I responded in the affirmative.  Truth to tell,
I was very glad of that opportunity to escape from
the eternal shopping in the High Street and the
round of Kensington life, which daily reminded me
of the man whom I had loved.  Ulrica knew it, but
she was careful to avoid all further mention of the
grief that was wearing out my heart.
</p>

<p>
At the outset of our pilgrimage to the South of
Europe we went to Paris.  In the gay city two
women with money and without encumbrances
can have a really good time.  We stayed at the
"Chatham," a hotel much resorted to by our
compatriots, and met there quite a lot of people we
knew, including several rather nice men whom
we had known in London, and who appeared to
consider it their duty to show us the sights, many of
which we had seen before.
</p>

<p>
Need I describe them?  I think not.  Those who
read these lines probably know them all, from that
sorry exhibition of terpsichorean art in the elephant
at the Red Windmill down to the so-called <i>cabarets
artistiques</i> of the Montmartre, "Heaven," "Hell,"
and the other places.
</p>

<p>
Each evening we dined at six, and went forth
pleasure-seeking, sometimes unattended, and at
others with our friends.  We were catholic in our
tastes.  We saw <i>La Bohême</i> at the Opera, and
attended a ball at the Bullier; we strolled along
the carpeted promenade of Aspasia at the Folies
Bergères, and laughed at the quadrilles at the
Casino, and at that resort of the little work-girls, the
Moulin la Galette; we listened to the cadence
of Sarah Bernhardt's wonderful voice, and to the
patter of the <i>revue</i> at La Scala; we watched the
dancing of La Belle Otero and the statuesque
poses of Degaby.  Truly, we had our fill of variety
theatres.
</p>

<p>
In common, too, with the foreigner who goes to
"see life" in Paris, we did the round of the
restaurants&mdash;from supper at the Cafê de Paris, or the
Cafê Américain, to the humble two-franc dinner at
Léon's in the Rue St. Honoré, or the one-franc-fifty
lunch at Gazal's in the Place du Théâtre Français.
We had our meal, too, one evening at that
restaurant which is seldom even mentioned in
respectable circles, the "Rat Mort," in the Place
Pigalle.  Yes, with money one is seldom <i>triste</i>
in Paris, and I was really sorry when, in the last
week of the year, after Felicita had packed our
trunks, we set out for the Riviera.
</p>

<p>
Travelling on those abominable gridirons which
on the Continent are called railways, is absolutely
disgusting after our own English lines, with their
dining-cars and other comforts.  Of all the
railways that intersect the Continent, the P.L.M.,
which has a monopoly to the Mediterranean, is the
most inconvenient, disobliging, and completely
abominable.  To obtain the smallest comfort on
the eighteen-hour journey between Paris and Nice,
an addition of three pounds is charged upon the
first-class fare, and that for a single night in a
third-rate sleeping-car!  Ulrica said it was termed the
<i>train de luxe</i> only because it looks swagger to travel
by it.  We occupied a couple of berths in it, but
agreed that the additional three pounds were ill-spent
indeed, for the badly-cooked food was absurdly
dear.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, as the water for toilet purposes gave out
before reaching Lyons, we had to buy bottles of
mineral water, and perform our ablutions in a
mixture of Vichy Celestins and eau-de-cologne.  It
was remarked by an old and apparently experienced
traveller that the water in the <i>wagons lits</i> is
purposely scanty in order to increase the takings of
the restaurant cars; and I certainly believed him.
</p>

<p>
For a woman young in years I have had
considerable experience of European railways, from
the crawling Midi of France to the lightning Nord;
but for dirt and dearness, commend me to the
great highway to the Riviera.  To take a small
trunk from Paris to Nice costs more than the fare
of one's maid; while to those who do not pay for
the train of luxury, but travel in the ordinary
padded horse-boxes, the journey means a couple of
days of suffocation and semi-starvation.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Carmela," said Ulrica, while we were
on the journey, "I've thought of a plan.  Why not
go to some cheap hotel, or even <i>pension</i> at Nice, and
play at Monte Carlo with the money we save?"
</p>

<p>
I had never seen the far-famed Monte Carlo, but
as the idea of economy seemed an excellent one, I
at once endorsed her suggestion, and that same night
we found ourselves at one of those <i>pensions</i> which
flourish so amazingly well at Nice.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
TELLS SOMETHING ABOUT LOVE
</h3>

<p>
Reader, have you ever lived in an English <i>pension</i>
on the Riviera?  Have you ever inhabited a small
cubicle containing a chair, a deal table, a narrow
bed&mdash;with mosquito curtains&mdash;and a hung-up
looking-glass, and partaken of that cheap,
ill-cooked food, the stale-egg omelette and the tough
<i>biftek</i>, served in the bare <i>salle-à-manger</i> by one of
those seedy, unshaven waiters who appear to be
specially bred for the cheap Riviera
boarding-houses?  Have you ever spent an evening with
that mixed crowd of ascetic persons who nightly
congregate in the fusty <i>salon</i>, play upon a cracked
piano, screech old-fashioned sentimentalities,
exhibit their faded finery, paste jewels and bony
chests, and otherwise make the hours, following
dinner absolutely hideous?  If not, a week of
this life will be found to be highly amusing.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," Ulrica whispered, as we followed the
proprietress, a buxom Frenchwoman in black satin,
along the bare, white-washed corridor to our rooms,
"hotel or work-house&mdash;which?"
</p>

<p>
There was a comfortless look everywhere, even
though the spread of the blue sea and the
palm-planted Promenade des Anglais were magnificent
parts of the view, and the warm winter sunshine
streamed into our tiny rooms&mdash;chambers so small
that our trunks had to be placed in the corridor.
</p>

<p>
We changed our frocks and went down to dinner,
discovering the <i>salle-à-manger</i> by its smell.  What
a scene presented itself at that <i>table d'hôte</i>!  The
long table was crowded by a host of dowdy women,
generally wearing caps of soiled lace and faded
ribbons, with one or two dismal-looking and elderly
men.  Of spinsters there were not a few, and of
widows many, but one and all possessed the stamp
of persons of small means struggling perseveringly to
obtain their fill for the ten francs <i>par jour</i> which they
paid for their "south rooms."
</p>

<p>
As new-comers, we were directed to seats at the
bottom of the table; and after we had suffered from
a watery concoction which the menu described as
<i>potage</i>, we proceeded to survey our fellow-guests
in that cheap and respectable <i>pension</i>.
</p>

<p>
That they were severely respectable there could
certainly be no doubt.  There were a couple of
drawling English clergymen, with their
wives&mdash;typical vicars' wives who patronised their
neighbours; two or three sad-faced young girls,
accompanied by ascetic relatives; a young Frenchman
who eyed Ulrica all the time; one or two
hen-pecked husbands of the usual type to be found
in such hostelries of the aged; and an old lady who
sat in state at the extreme end of the table, and
much amused us by her efforts at juvenility.
Besides ourselves, she was apparently the only person
who had a maid with her; and in order to exhibit
that fact, she sent for her smelling-salts during
dinner.  She was long past sixty, yet dressed in
a style becoming a girl of eighteen, in bright colours
and lace, her fair wig being dressed in the latest
Parisian style, and the wrinkles of her cheeks
filled up by various creams and face powders.
</p>

<p>
"That old crow is an absolute terror!" observed
Ulrica to me in an undertone, and out of sheer devilry
she at once commenced a conversation with this
rejuvenated hag, who, as we learned later, was an
exportation from one of the London suburbs.
</p>

<p>
The conversation, started by Ulrica and continued
by myself, proved most amusing to us both.  The
old woman whose name was Blackett, had just
enough to live upon, we afterwards discovered, but
came each year to the <i>pension</i> in order to cut a
dash as a <i>grande dame</i>.  Her fingers were covered
with paste jewels, and her finery was all of that
cheap and tawdry kind which affects the nerves as
well as the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" she said, in a carefully cultivated
voice, intended to show good breeding, "if this is
your first visit to the Riviera, you'll be quite
charmed&mdash;everyone is charmed with it.  As for
myself&mdash;" and she sighed,&mdash;"I have been here
each year for I don't know how long."
</p>

<p>
"And there is lots to see?"
</p>

<p>
"Lots.  Only you must drive, you know.  I
myself drive at all hours of the day, and when the
moon is up I go for moonlight drives into the
mountains."
</p>

<p>
How romantic, I thought.
</p>

<p>
"I have my own coachman, you know," she
added.  "I keep him all the year round."
</p>

<p>
She had led up to the conversation merely in
order to inform us of her generosity.
</p>

<p>
So throughout the meal, which occupied nearly
two hours, by reason of inadequate waiting, we
continued to draw her out, humour her egotism, and
cause her to make a most ridiculous display of
herself, until at last, my sentiment changing, I felt
genuinely sorry for her.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I remarked to Ulrica as we left
the table, "this is the most extraordinary collection
of tabbies I've ever met."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "what has been puzzling me
all the evening is their place of origin.  Some, I
regret to say, are actually our own compatriots.  But
where do they come from?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a special breed peculiar to <i>pensions</i> on the
Riviera," I remarked; and together we ascended
to the frowsy drawing-room, where the red plush-covered
furniture exuded an odour of mustiness, and
the carpet was sadly moth-eaten and thread-bare.
</p>

<p>
Around the central table a dozen angular women
of uncertain age grouped themselves and formed a
sewing-party; a retired colonel, who seemed a
good fellow, buried himself in the <i>Contemporary</i>;
a decrepit old gentleman wearing a skull-cap and a
shawl about his shoulders, heaped logs upon the
fire and sat with his feet on the fender, although
the atmosphere was stifling, while somebody else
induced a young lady with a voice like a file to
sing a plaintive love-song, accompanied by the
untuned piano.
</p>

<p>
During my previous winters in the South I had
stayed at hotels.  In my ignorance of the ways of
cheap visitors to the Riviera, I believed this
congregation to be unique, but Ulrica assured me that it
was typical of all English <i>pensions</i> along the Côte
d'Azur, from Cannes to Bordighera, and I can now
fully endorse her statement.
</p>

<p>
To describe in detail the many comic scenes
enacted is unnecessary.  The people were too
ludicrous for words.  One family in especial
endeavoured to entice us to friendliness.  Its head
was a very tall, muscular, black-haired
French-woman, who had married an Englishman.  The
latter had died fifteen years ago, leaving her with
a son and daughter, the former a school boy of
sixteen, and the latter a fair-haired and very
freckled girl of perhaps twenty.  The woman's
name was Egerton, and she was of that dashing
type who can wear scarlet dresses at dinner, and
whose cheeks dazzle one's eyes on account of the
rouge upon them.  She was loud, coarse, and
vulgar.  For the benefit of all the others, she
spoke daily of the delicacies prepared by her own
<i>chef</i>, sneered at the food of the <i>pension</i>, and ordered
special messes for her own consumption.  Before
we had known her an hour she had given us a
description of the wonderful interior of her house in
Rome, enumerated her servants, and gave us to
understand that she was exceedingly well-off, and
quite a superior person.  The people one meets
on the Riviera are really very entertaining.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica was grimly sarcastic.  As we had neither
intention nor inclination to associate with this
superior relict, we politely snubbed her, taking care
that it should not be done in secret.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think our effort at economy has met with
very much success," I remarked to Ulrica, when
about a week later I sat over the cup of half-cold
coffee, the stale egg, the hunk of bread and the pat
of rancid butter, which together formed my breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"No, a week of it is quite sufficient," she laughed.
"We'll leave to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've given notice?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  I only came here for a week's
amusement.  We'll go on to the 'Grand.'"
</p>

<p>
So on the following day our trunks were called for
by the hotel omnibus, and we took up our quarters
in that well-known hotel on the Quai St. Jean
Baptiste.  Ulrica had known the Riviera ever
since her girlhood.  With her parents she had
gone abroad each autumn, had seen most of the
sights, and had thus received her education as a
smart woman.
</p>

<p>
We were in the <i>salon</i> of the "Grand" on the
night of our arrival, when suddenly someone
uttered my name.  We both turned quickly, and
to our surprise saw two men we knew quite well in
London standing before us.  One was Reginald
Thorne, a dark-haired and more than usually
good-looking youth of about twenty-two or so,
while the other was Gerald Keppel, a thin,
fair-moustached young man, some seven years his
senior, son of old Benjamin Keppel, the well-known
South African millionaire.  Gerald was an old
friend, but the former I knew but slightly, having
met him once or twice at dances, for in Kensington
he was among the chief of the eligibles.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear Miss Rosselli!" he cried
enthusiastically as we shook hands.  "I'm so awfully
glad to meet you!  I had no idea you were here.
Gerald was here dining with me, and we caught
sight of you through the glass doors."
</p>

<p>
"Then you're staying here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Gerald's staying with his guv'nor.  He
has a villa out at Fabron.  Have you been here
long?"
</p>

<p>
"We've been in Nice a week," interposed Ulrica,
"and we haven't found a single soul we know until
now.  I feel sure you'll take pity upon our
loneliness, Mr. Thorne, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" he laughed.  "I suppose you
go to Monte Carlo?"
</p>

<p>
"You men think of nothing but roulette and
dinners at the 'Paris,'" she responded reproachfully,
adding: "But after all, should we be women
if we had no soul for gambling?  Have you had
any luck this season?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't complain," he smiled.  "I've been staying
over there for ten days or so.  Gerald has had quite
a run of good fortune.  The other night he won the
maximum on the <i>zero-trois</i> three times."
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, my dear Gerald!" exclaimed
Ulrica approvingly.  "You shall both take us
over one day and let us try our fortune&mdash;if
Mr. Thorne is agreeable."
</p>

<p>
"Delighted, I'm sure," answered the latter,
glancing at me; and by the look he gave me I felt
convinced that my suspicions, aroused in London
about a year before, were not quite groundless.
His glance was a convincing proof that he admired me.
</p>

<p>
The fault of us women is that we so often
over-esteem the value of our good looks.  To my mind
the possession of handsome toilettes is quite as
essential to a woman's well-being and man's
contentment as are personal attractions.  A woman,
however beautiful she may be, loses half her charm
to men's eyes if she dresses dowdily, or without
taste.  Nobody ever saw a really beautiful Parisienne.
For the most part, the ladies of the French
capital are thin-nosed, thin-lipped, scraggy-necked,
yellow-faced and absolutely ugly; yet are they not,
merely by reason of their <i>chic</i> in dress, the most
attractive women in the world?  I know that many
will dissent from this estimate; but as my mirror
tells me that I have a face more than commonly
handsome, and as dozens of men have further
endorsed the mute evidence of my toilet-glass, I
can only confess that all my triumphs and all my
harmless flirtations have had their beginnings in
the attraction exercised by the dainty creations
of my <i>couturière</i>.  We hear much complaining
among women to the effect that there are not a
sufficient number of nice men to go round; but
after all, the woman who knows how to dress need
have no lack of offers of marriage.  American
women on the Continent can always be distinguished
from the English, and it is certain that to their
quiet <i>chic</i> in frills and furbelows their success in
the marriage market is due.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there was no doubt that Reggie Thorne
admired me.  I had suspected it on the night when
we had waltzed together at the Pendyman's, and
afterwards gossiped together over ices; but with
a woman flirtations of the ball-room are soon
forgotten, and, truth to tell, I had forgotten him
until our sudden and unexpected meeting.
</p>

<p>
"What awfully good luck we've met Gerald and
Reggie," Ulrica said, when, half-an-hour later, we
were seated together in the privacy of our sitting-room.
"Gerald, poor boy, was always a bit gone on
me in London; and as for Reggie&mdash;well, he'll
make an excellent cavalier for you.  Even if Mother
Grundy is dead and buried, it isn't very respectable
to be constantly trotting over to Monte Carlo
without male escort."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that they'll be a couple of useful
males?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  Their coming is quite providential.
Some of Gerald's luck at the tables may be reflected
upon us.  I should dearly like to make my expenses
at roulette."
</p>

<p>
"So should I."
</p>

<p>
"There's no reason why we shouldn't," she went
on.  "I know quite a lot of people who've won
enough to pay for the whole winter on the Riviera."
</p>

<p>
"Reggie has money, hasn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  The old man was on the Stock
Exchange and died very comfortably off.  All of it
went to Reggie, except an annuity settled on his
mother.  Of course, he's spent a good deal since.
A man doesn't live in the Albany as he does, drive
tandem, and all that sort of thing, on nothing a
year."
</p>

<p>
"They used to say that Gerald Keppel hadn't a
shilling beyond what the old man allowed him
monthly&mdash;a most niggardly allowance, I've
heard."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite possible, my dear Carmela," she
answered.  "But one's position might be a good
deal worse than the only son of a millionaire.  Old
Benjamin is eccentric.  I've met the old buffer
several times.  He's addicted to my pet abomination
in a man&mdash;paper collars."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll take Gerald as your cavalier, and
allot Reggie to me?" I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'm self-sacrificing, am I not?"
</p>

<p>
She was in high spirits, for she had long ago
fascinated Gerald Keppel, and now intended to
make use of him as her escort to that Palace of
Delight which somebody has suggested might well
be known as the Sign of the Seven Sins.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica was a typical woman of the up-to-date
type&mdash;pretty, with soft, wavy, chestnut hair and
a pair of brown eyes that had attracted a host of
men who had bowed down and worshipped at her
shrine; yet beneath her corsets, as I alone knew,
there beat a heart from which, alas! all love and
sympathy had long ago died out.  To her, excitement,
change and flirtation were as food and
drink; she could not live without them.  Neither,
indeed, could I, for by living with her ever
since my convent-days I had copied her smart
ideas and notions, stimulated by attacks of
nerves.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, having lunched with Reggie
and Gerald at the hotel, we went over with the
usual crowd to Monte Carlo by the two o'clock
"yellow" express.
</p>

<p>
Reader, you probably know the panorama of the
Riviera&mdash;that stretch of azure sky, azure sea,
rugged coast; purple hills clad with olives and
pines; rose, heliotrope, and geranium running
riot in the gardens of the white villas, with their
marble terraces.
</p>

<p>
When I entered for the first time that wild,
turbulent, close-smelling <i>salle de jeu</i> at Monte
Carlo, where the croupiers were crying in strident
tones, "<i>Messieurs, faites vos jeux!</i>" and uttering
in warning voice, "<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>" I gazed around
me bewildered.  Who were those grabbing crowds
of smartly-dressed people grouped around the
tables?  Were they actually civilised human
beings&mdash;beings who had loved, suffered and lived,
as I had loved, suffered and lived?
</p>

<p>
How beautiful it was outside in that gay little
place, with the Red Hungarian Band playing on
the terrace of the Café de Paris, and half the <i>grand
monde</i> of Europe lounging about and chattering!
How enchanting was the grim Dog's Head as a
fitting background in dark purple against the
winter sunset, the brown Grimaldi rock rising sheer
from the sea to the castellated walls of the Palace;
to the right, Villefranche and San Juan dark upon
the horizon,&mdash;the serrated Esterels dark and
mysterious afar; while to the left, Bordighera was
sparkling white in the sunshine.  And beyond there
was Italy&mdash;my own fair Italy!  Out in that
flower-scented, limpid air earth was a paradise; within
those stifling gilt saloons, where the light of day was
tempered by the thick curtains, and the clink of
gold mingled with the dull hum of the avaricious
crowd, it was a veritable hell.
</p>

<p>
Some years ago&mdash;ah! now I am looking back;
Ulrica is not at fault this time.  No, I must not
think.  I have promised myself not to think during
my work upon this narrative, but to try to forget all
past unhappiness.  To try!  Ah!  I would that
I could calm my soul&mdash;steep it in a draught of such
thoughtlessness that oblivion would come!  But
I fear that can never, never be!
</p>

<p>
It is terrible to think how a woman can suffer,
and yet live.  What a blessing it is that the world
cannot read a woman's heart!  Men may look
upon our faces, but they cannot read the truth.
Even though our hearts may be breaking, we may
wear a smile; we can conceal our sorrows so cleverly
that none can suspect, for smiles make a part of
our physical being; we can hide our grief so
completely that none can know the burden upon us.
Endurance, resistance, patience, suffering, all these
belong to woman's heritage.  Even in the few
years I have lived, I have had my share of them
all.
</p>

<p>
I stood bewildered, watching the revolving red
and black roulette-wheel, and the eager crowd of
faces around it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vingt!  Rouge, pair et passe!</i>" the croupier
cried, and a couple of louis which Ulrica had placed
on the last dozen were swept away with the silver,
notes and gold, to swell the bank.
</p>

<p>
I thought of my secret grief.  I thought of
Ernest Cameron, and pursed my lips.  The old
Tuscan proverb which the nuns in Firenze had
taught me so long ago was very true: "<i>Amore non
é senza amaro</i>."
</p>

<p>
The millionaire's son at my elbow was explaining
to me how the game was played, but I was paying
no attention.  I only remembered the man I had
once loved&mdash;the man whose slave I was&mdash;the man
whom I had forgiven, even though he had left me
so cruelly.  Only three things could make life to
me worth living&mdash;the sight of his face, the sound
of his voice, the touch of his lips.
</p>

<p>
But such fine fortune could never be.  We
were parted for ever&mdash;for ever!
</p>

<p>
"Now, play this time!" I heard Reggie exclaim.
</p>

<p>
"Where?" I inquired mechanically, his voice
awakening me to a sense of my surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"On the line, there&mdash;between the numbers 9
and 12."
</p>

<p>
I took a louis from my purse, and with the rake
carelessly pushed it upon the line he had indicated.
Then I turned to talk with Gerald.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>" cried the croupier.
</p>

<p>
A hundred necks were craned to watch the
result.
</p>

<p>
The ball fell with a final click into one of the
little spaces upon the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Neuf!  Rouge, impair et manque!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You've won, my dear!" cried Ulrica excitedly,
and in a few moments Reggie, who raked up my
winnings, gave me quite a handful of gold.
</p>

<p>
"There now!" he said, "you've made your first
<i>coup</i>.  Try again."
</p>

<p>
I crammed the gold into my purse, but it would
not hold it all.  The three louis upon which the
purse would not close I held doubtfully in my
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Play on the <i>treize-dix-huit</i> this time!" urged
Reggie, and I obeyed him blindly.
</p>

<p>
As the number 18 came up, I again received
another little handful of gold.  I knew that many
envious eyes were cast in my direction, and the
excitement of winning was an entirely new
sensation.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica fancied the last dozen, and I placed five
louis upon it, winning a third time.  Having won
eight hundred francs in three turns of the wheel,
I began to think roulette was not such wearying
fun as I had once believed it to be.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to continue playing, but the others
prevented me.  They knew too well that the bank
at Monte Carlo only lends its money to the players.
With Reggie at my side I went out, strolled
through those beautiful gardens beside the sea,
watched the pigeon-shooting, and afterwards sat
on the terrace of the Café de Paris, where to the
full I enjoyed a sunset of extraordinary radiance.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
IS A MYSTERY
</h3>

<p>
I was left alone with Reggie, for Ulrica had taken
Gerald into the orchestral concert.
</p>

<p>
"What awfully good luck you had!" he
observed, after we had been chatting some time.
"If you'd had the maximum on each time, you'd
have won over seven hundred pounds."
</p>

<p>
"There are a good many 'ifs' in gambling,"
I remarked.  "I've never had any luck before in
gambles at bazaars and such-like places."
</p>

<p>
"When you do have luck, follow it, is my motto,"
he laughed.  "I should have advised you to
continue playing to-day, only I thought it might
annoy Ulrica," and he raised his whisky and seltzer
to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"But I might have lost all I won," I remarked.
"No, I prefer to keep it.  I'd like to be unique
among other people and go away with some of the
bank's money, I intend to keep what I have,
and not to play again."
</p>

<p>
"Never?"
</p>

<p>
"Never!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Rosselli, that's what everyone
says here," he laughed.  "But before you've been
on the Riviera long you'll soon discover that this
is no place for good resolutions.  Gambling is one
of the sweetest and most insidious of vices, and
has the additional attraction of being thought
<i>chic</i>.  Look at the crowd of women here!  Why,
every one of them plays.  If she didn't, others
would believe her to be hard-up&mdash;and poverty, you
know, is distinctly bad form here.  Even if a
woman hasn't sufficient to pay her hotel bill, she
must wear the regulation gold chatelaine and the
gold chain-purse, if it only contains a couple of
pieces of a hundred sous.  And she must play.
Fortunes have been won with only five francs."
</p>

<p>
"Such stories, I fear, are only fairy tales," I
said incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"No.  At least, one of them is not," he answered,
blowing a cloud of smoke from his lips and looking
at me amusedly.  "I was playing here one night
last March when a young French girl won three
hundred thousand francs after having first lost all
she had.  She borrowed a five-franc piece from
a friend, and with it broke the bank.  I was
present at the table where it occurred.  Fortune is
very fickle here."
</p>

<p>
"So it seems," I said.  "That is why I intend
to keep what I've won."
</p>

<p>
"You might have a necklace made of the louis,"
he said.  "Many women wear coins won at Monte
attached to their bangles, along with golden pigs
and enamelled discs bearing the fatal number
thirteen."
</p>

<p>
"A happy thought!" I exclaimed.  "I'll have
one put on my bangle to-morrow as a souvenir."
</p>

<p>
"Are you staying on the Riviera long?" he
inquired presently.
</p>

<p>
"I really don't know.  When Ulrica is tired
of it we shall move down to Rome, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"When she's lost sufficient, you mean," he smiled.
"She's quite reckless when she commences.  I
remember her here several seasons ago.  She lost
very heavily.  Luck was entirely against her."
</p>

<p>
I, too, remember her visit.  She left me in
London and went to the Riviera for a couple of
months, and on her return was constantly
bewailing her penury.  This, then, was the secret
of it.  She had never revealed to me the truth.
</p>

<p>
"And you think that I shall be stricken with the
prevalent epidemic?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," he answered quickly.  "But,
after all, the temptation is utterly irresistible.  It
is sad, indeed, that here, in this corner of God's
earth, which He has marked as the nearest approach
to Paradise created, should be allowed to flaunt
all the vices which render the world horrible.
Monte Carlo is the one blot upon the Riviera.
I'm a gambler&mdash;I make no secret of it, because I
find resistance impossible while I have money in
my pocket&mdash;nevertheless, much as I like a fling
here each winter, I would gladly welcome the
closing of the Casino.  It has been well said that
those red-carpeted steps and the wide doors
opposite form the entrance-gate to hell."
</p>

<p>
I sighed, glancing over to the flight of steps
opposite, where all sorts of women, wintering
among temptations in summer toilettes, were
passing up and down.  He was possessed of
common sense, and spoke the truth.  Inside those
Rooms the perspiring and perfumed crowds were
fluttering round the tables as moths round a candle,
going headlong to ruin, both moral and financial.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I observed reflectively, "I suppose
you're right.  Thousands have been ruined within
that place."
</p>

<p>
"And thousands have ended by committing
suicide," he added.  "The average number of
suicides within this tiny Principality of Monaco
is more than two a day!"
</p>

<p>
"More than two a day!" I exclaimed incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Of course, the authorities bribe the Press
to hush it all up, but the authentic figures were
published not long ago.  The Administrator of the
Casino finds it cheaper to bury a corpse than to
pay a ruined gambler's fare to St. Petersburg,
London, or New York.  That's why the poor
devils who are cleaned out find the much-talked-of
<i>viatique</i> so difficult to obtain.  Human life is held
very cheap here, I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk like that!" I protested.  "You
make one feel quite nervous.  Do you mean that
murder is often committed?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;not exactly that.  But one must always
remember that here, mixing with the best people
of Europe, are the very scum of the world, both
male and female.  Although they dress elegantly,
live well, play boldly, and give themselves airs and
false titles of nobility, and wear decorations to
which they are not entitled, they are a very queer
and unscrupulous crowd, I can assure you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know any of them by sight?" I
inquired, much interested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, one or two," he answered, laughing.
"Some of them are, of course, eccentric and quite
harmless characters."  Then a moment later he
added: "Do you see that tall, thin old man just
ascending the steps&mdash;the one with the soft white
felt hat?  Well, his is a curious story.  Twenty
years ago he came here as a millionaire, and within
a month lost everything he possessed at <i>trente et
quarante</i>.  So huge were the profits made by the
bank that, instead of giving him his <i>viatique</i> to
London, they allotted him a pension of a louis
a day for life, on the understanding that he should
never again enter the Rooms.  For nearly twenty
years he lived in Nice, haunting the Promenade des
Anglais, and brooding over his past foolishness.
Last year, however, somebody died unexpectedly,
and left him quite comfortably off, whereupon he
paid back to Monte Carlo all that he had received
and returned again to gamble.  His luck, however,
has proved just as bad as before.  Yet each month,
as soon as he draws his income, he comes over,
and in a single day flings it all away upon the
red, his favourite colour.  His history is only one
of many."
</p>

<p>
With interest I looked at the tall, thin-faced old
gambler as he painfully ascended the steps; and
even as I watched he passed in, eager to fling
away all that stood between himself and starvation.
</p>

<p>
Truly, the world of Monte Carlo is a very queer
place.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica and Gerald came laughing across the leafy
Place and joined us at our table.  It was very
pleasant there, with the band playing the latest
waltzes, the gay promenaders strolling beneath
the palms, the bright flowers and the pigeons
strutting in the roadway.  Indeed, as one sat there
it seemed hard to believe that this was actually
the much-talked-of Monte Carlo&mdash;the plague-spot
of Europe.
</p>

<p>
I don't think that I ever saw Ulrica look so
well as on that afternoon in the white serge which
she had had made in Paris; for white serge is, as
you know, always <i>de rigueur</i> at Monte in winter,
with white hat and white shoes.  I was also in
white, but it never suited me as it did her, yet one
had to be smart, even at the expense of one's
complexion.  At Monte Carlo one must at least be
respectable, even in one's vices.
</p>

<p>
"Come, let's go back to the Rooms," suggested
Ulrica, when she had finished her tea, flavoured with
orange-flower water in accordance with the mode
at the Café de Paris.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rosselli won't play any more," said Reggie.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Carmela!" cried Ulrica.  "Why,
surely, you've the pluck to follow your good
fortune!"
</p>

<p>
But I was obdurate, and although I accompanied
the others I did not risk a single sou.
</p>

<p>
The place was crowded, and the atmosphere
absolutely unbearable, as it always becomes about
five o'clock.  The Administration appear afraid
of letting in a little air to cool the heads of the
players, hence the Rooms are, as it were,
hermetically sealed.
</p>

<p>
As I wandered about with Reggie, he pointed out
to me other well-known characters in the Rooms&mdash;the
queer old fellow who carries a bag-purse made
of coloured beads; the old hag with a moustache
who always brings her own rake; the bright-eyed,
dashing woman known to the croupiers as "The
Golden Hand"; the thin, wizen-faced little hunch-back,
who one night a few months before had broken
the bank at the first roulette table on the left;
men working so-called "systems," and women
trying to snatch up other people's winnings.  Now
and then my companion placed a louis upon a
<i>transversale</i> or <i>colonne</i>, and once or twice he won;
but declaring that he had no luck that day, he
soon grew as tired of it as myself.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica came up to us flushed with excitement.
She had won three hundred francs at the table
where she always played.  Her favourite croupier
was turning the wheel, and he always brought her
luck.  We had both won, and she declared it to be
a happy augury for the future.
</p>

<p>
While we were standing there the croupier's
voice sounded loud and clear "Zero!" with that
long roll of the "r" which <i>habitués</i> of the Rooms
know so well.
</p>

<p>
"Zero!" cried Reggie.  "By Jove!  I must
put something on," and hurrying toward the table
he handed the croupier a hundred-franc note,
with a request to put it on the number 29.
</p>

<p>
The game was made and the ball fell.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vingt-neuf!  Rouge, impair et passe!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" cried Gerald.  "He's won!  Lucky
devil!  How extraordinary that after zero the
number 29 so frequently follows!"
</p>

<p>
The croupier handed Reggie three thousand-franc
notes and quite a handful of gold.  Then the lucky
player moved his original stake on to the little
square marked 36.
</p>

<p>
Again he won, and again and again.  The three
thousand-franc notes he had just received he placed
upon the middle dozen.  The number 18 turned up,
and the croupier handed him six thousand francs&mdash;the
maximum paid by the bank on a single <i>coup</i>.
Every eye around that table watched him
narrowly.  People began to follow his play, placing
their money beside his, and time after time he won,
making only a few unimportant losses.
</p>

<p>
We stood watching him in silent wonder.  The
luck of the man with whom I had been flirting
was simply marvellous.  Sometimes he distributed
his stakes on the colour, the dozens and the "pair,"
and thus often won in several places at the same
time.  The eager, grabbing crowd surged round
the table and the excitement quickly rose to fever
heat.  The assault Reggie was making upon the
bank was certainly a formidable one.  His inner
pockets bulged with the mass of notes he had
crammed there, and the outer pockets of his jacket
were heavy with golden louis.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica stood behind him, but uttered no word.
To speak to a person while playing is believed by
the gambler at Monte Carlo to bring evil fortune.
</p>

<p>
When he could cram no more notes into his
pockets, he passed them to Ulrica, who held them
in an overflow bundle in her hand.
</p>

<p>
He tossed a thousand francs on the red, but lost,
together with the dozens of others who had
followed his play.
</p>

<p>
He played again, with no better result.
</p>

<p>
A third time he played on the red, which had not
been up for nine times in succession, a most unusual
run.
</p>

<p>
Black won.
</p>

<p>
"I've finished," he said, turning to us with a
laugh.  "Let's get out of this&mdash;my luck has
changed."
</p>

<p>
"Marvellous!" cried Ulrica.  "Why, you must
have won quite a fortune!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll go across to the Café and count it," he
said, and we all walked out together; and while
sitting at one of the tables we helped him to count
the piles of gold and notes.
</p>

<p>
He had, we found, won over sixty thousand francs.
</p>

<p>
At his invitation we went along to Gast's, the
jeweller's, in the Galerie, and he there purchased
for each of us a ring as a little souvenir of the day.
Then we entered Giro's and dined.
</p>

<p>
Yes, life at Monte Carlo is absolutely intoxicating.
Now, however, that I sit here calmly reflecting on
the events of that day when I first entered the
Sign of the Seven Sins, I find that even though
the display of such wealth as one sees upon the
tables is dazzling, yet my first impression of it has
never been altered.
</p>

<p>
I hated Monte Carlo from the first.  I hate it
now.
</p>

<p>
The talk at dinner was, of course, the argot of
the Rooms.  At Monte Carlo the conversation is
always of play.  If you meet an acquaintance, you
do not ask after her health, but of her luck and her
latest successes.
</p>

<p>
The two bejewelled worlds, the <i>monde</i> and the
<i>demi-monde</i>, ate, drank, and chattered in that
restaurant of wide renown.  The company was
cosmopolitan, the conversation polyglot, the dishes
marvellous.  At the table next us there sat the
Grand-Duke Michael of Russia, with the Countess
Torby, and beyond a British earl with a couple of
smart military men.  The United States Ambassador
to Germany was at another table with a small
party of friends; while La Juniori, Derval, and
several other well-known Parisian beauties were
scattered here and there.
</p>

<p>
I was laughing at a joke of Reggie's, when
suddenly I raised my eyes and saw a pair of
new-comers.  The man was tall, dark, handsome, with
face a trifle bronzed&mdash;a face I knew only too well!
</p>

<p>
I started, and must have turned pale, for I knew
from Ulrica's expression that she noticed it.
</p>

<p>
The man who entered there, as though to taunt
me with his presence, was Ernest Cameron, the
man whom I had loved&mdash;nay, whom I still loved&mdash;the
man who had a year ago cast me aside for
another and left me to wear out my young heart
in sorrow and suffering.
</p>

<p>
That woman was with him&mdash;the tow-haired
woman whom they told me he had promised to
make his wife.  I had never seen her before.  She
was rather <i>petite</i>, with a fair, fluffy coiffure,
blue-grey eyes and pink-and-white cheeks.  She had
earned, I afterwards discovered, a rather unenviable
notoriety in Paris on account of some scandal
or other, but the real truth about it I could never
ascertain.
</p>

<p>
Our eyes met as she entered, but she was
unaware that she gazed upon the woman who was her
rival, and who hated her.  She had stolen Ernest
from me, and I felt that I could rise there, in that
public place, and crush the life from that fragile
body.
</p>

<p>
Ernest himself brushed past my chair, but without
recognising me, and went down the room gaily
with his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Do you notice who has just entered?" asked
Ulrica.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  I could not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" inquired Reggie quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Some friends of ours," she answered carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! everyone meets friends here," he remarked,
as he raised his champagne unsuspectingly to his
lips.
</p>

<p>
Reader, if you are a woman, you will fully
understand how the sight of that man who held me by
a fatal fascination, caused in my breast a whirl of
passions.  I hated and loved at the same instant.
Even though we were parted, I had never ceased
to think of him.  For me the world had no longer
any charm, since the light of my life had now gone
out, and I was suffering in silence, just as so many
women who have become the sport of Fate are
bound to do.
</p>

<p>
Yes.  Ulrica's notion was, after all, very true.
No man whom I had ever met was really worth
consideration.  All were egoists.  The rich believed
that woman was a mere toy, while the poor were
always ineligible.
</p>

<p>
Reggie spoke to me, but I scarcely heeded him.
Now that the man I loved was near me, I felt an
increasing desire to get rid of this male
encumbrance.  True, he was rich, and I knew, by my own
feminine intuition, that he admired me, but for him
I entertained no spark of affection.  Alas! that
we always sigh for the unattainable.
</p>

<p>
For myself, the remainder of the meal was
utterly without interest.  I longed to get another
glimpse of that man's bronzed face, and of the
tow-haired woman whom he had preferred to me,
but they were evidently sitting at a table in the
corner out of sight.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica knew the truth, and took compassion
upon me by hastening the dinner to its end.  Then
we went forth again into the cool, balmy night.
The moon shone brightly, and its reflection glittered
in a long stream of silver brilliance upon the sea;
the Place was gaily lit and the white façade of the
Casino, with its great illuminated clock, shone with
lights of every hue.
</p>

<p>
Across to the Hermitage we strolled, and there
drank our coffee.
</p>

<p>
I laughed at Reggie's pockets bulging with notes,
for, the banks being closed, he was compelled to
carry his winnings about with him.  While we sat
there, however, a brilliant idea occurred to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly all these notes are small," he said
suddenly.  "I'll go into the Rooms and exchange the
gold and small notes for large ones.  They'll
be so much easier to carry."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried Ulrica, "I never thought of that.
Why, of course!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he answered, rising.  "I shan't
be ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be tempted to play again, old fellow,"
urged Gerald.
</p>

<p>
"No fear of that!" he laughed, and, with a
cigarette in his mouth, strode away in the direction
of the Casino.
</p>

<p>
We remained there gossiping for fully half an
hour, yet he did not return.  As it was only a walk
of a couple of minutes from the Hermitage to the
Casino, we concluded that he had met some friend
and been detained, for, like Gerald, he came there
each winter and knew quite a host of people.  One
makes a large circle of acquaintances on the
Riviera, many interesting, but the majority undesirable.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where he's got to?" Gerald observed
presently.  "Surely he isn't such an idiot
as to resume play!"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He's well enough aware that there's no
luck after dinner," remarked Ulrica.  "We might,
however, I think, take a last turn through the
Rooms and see whether he's there."
</p>

<p>
This suggestion was carried out, but although
we searched every table we failed to discover him.
Until ten o'clock we lounged about, then returned
by the express to Nice.
</p>

<p>
That he should have left us in that abrupt manner
was certainly curious; but as Gerald declared he
was always erratic in his movements, and that
his explanation in the morning would undoubtedly
be found entirely satisfactory, we returned together
to the hotel, where we wished our companion good-night,
and ascended in the elevator to our own
sitting-room on the second floor.
</p>

<p>
My good fortune pleased me, but my heart was
nevertheless overburdened with sorrow.  The
sight of Ernest had reopened the gaping wound
which I had so strenuously striven to heal by
the aid of lighter woes.  I now thought only of
him.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica, who was in front of me, pushed open
the door of our sitting-room and switched on the
light, but ere she crossed the threshold she drew
back quickly with a loud cry of horror and
surprise.
</p>

<p>
In an instant I was at her side.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" she gasped, terrified, pointing to the
opposite side of the room.  "Look!"
</p>

<p>
The body of a man was lying, face downwards,
upon the carpet, half hidden by the round table
in the centre of the room.
</p>

<p>
Together we dashed forward to his assistance
and tried to raise him, but were unable.  We
succeeded, however, in turning him upon his side,
and then his white, hard-set features became
suddenly revealed.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" I cried, awe-stricken.  "What has
occurred?  Why&mdash;it's Reggie!"
</p>

<p>
"Reggie!" shrieked Ulrica, kneeling quickly
and placing her gloved hand eagerly upon his
heart.  "Reggie!&mdash;and he's dead!".
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" I gasped, almost petrified by
the hideous discovery.
</p>

<p>
"It is true," she went on, her face white as that
of the dead man before us.  "Look, there's blood
upon his lips.  See&mdash;the chair over there is thrown
down and broken.  There has apparently been a
fierce struggle."
</p>

<p>
Next instant a thought occurred to me, and
bending, I quickly searched his inner pockets.
The bank-notes were not there.
</p>

<p>
Then the ghastly truth became entirely plain.
</p>

<p>
Reginald Thorne had been robbed and murdered.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
RELATES SOME ASTOUNDING FACTS
</h3>

<p>
The amazing discovery held us in speechless
bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
The favourite of Fortune, who only a couple of
hours before had been so full of life and buoyant
spirits, and who had left us with a promise to
return within ten minutes, was now lying still
and dead in the privacy of our own room.  The
ghastly truth was so strange and unexpected
as to utterly stagger belief.  A mysterious and
dastardly crime had evidently been committed
there.
</p>

<p>
I scarce know what occurred during the quarter
of an hour that immediately followed our astounding
discovery.  All I remember is that Ulrica,
with face blanched to the lips, ran out into the
corridor and raised the alarm.  Then there arrived
a crowd of waiters, chambermaids, and visitors,
everyone excitedly asking strings of questions, until
the hotel manager came and closed the door upon
them all.  The discovery caused the most profound
sensation, especially when the police and doctors
arrived quickly, followed shortly afterwards by two
detectives.
</p>

<p>
The doctor, a short, stout Frenchman, at once
pronounced that poor Reggie had been dead more
than half an hour, but the cursory examination he
was enabled to make was insufficient to establish
the cause of death.
</p>

<p>
"Do you incline to a theory of death through
violence?" one of the detectives inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! at present I cannot tell," the other
answered dubiously.  "It is not at all plain that
monsieur has been murdered."
</p>

<p>
Ulrica and I quickly found ourselves in a most
unpleasant position.  First, a man had been found
dead in our apartments, which was sufficient to
cause a good deal of ill-natured gossip; and
secondly, the police seemed to entertain some
suspicion of us.  We were both cross-questioned
separately as to Reggie's identity, what we knew
of him, and of our doings at Monte Carlo that
day.  In response, we made no secrets of our
movements, for we felt that the police might be able
to trace the culprit&mdash;if, indeed, Reggie had been
actually murdered.  The fact of his having won so
much money, and of his having left us in order
to change the notes into larger ones, seemed to
puzzle the police.  If robbery had been the object
of the crime, the murderer would, they argued,
no doubt have committed the deed either in the
train, or in the street.  Why, indeed, should the
victim have entered our sitting-room at all?
</p>

<p>
That really seemed the principal problem.  The
whole of the circumstances formed a complete and
puzzling enigma, but his visit to our sitting-room
was the most curious feature of all.
</p>

<p>
The thief, whoever he was&mdash;for I inclined towards
the theory of theft and murder&mdash;had been enabled
to effect his purpose swiftly, and leave the hotel
without discovery; while another curious fact
was that neither the <i>concierge</i> nor the elevator-lad
recollected the dead man's return.  Both agreed
that he must have slipped in unobserved.  And if
so, why?
</p>

<p>
Having concluded their examination of Ulrica,
myself and Felicita, my Italian maid, who had
returned from her evening out, and knew nothing
at all of the matter, the police made a most vigorous
search in our rooms.  We were present, and had
the dissatisfaction of watching our best gowns and
other articles tumbled over and mauled by unclean
hands.  Not a corner was left unexamined, for
when the French police make a search they at least
do it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! what is this?" exclaimed one of the
detectives, picking from the open fire-place in the
sitting-room a crumpled piece of paper, which
he smoothed out carefully.
</p>

<p>
In an instant we were all eager attention.  I saw
that it was a sheet of my own note-paper, and upon
it, in a man's handwriting, was the commencement
of a letter:
</p>

<p>
"<i>My dear Miss Rosselli,&mdash;I have&mdash;&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p>
That was all.  It broke off short.  There were
no other words.  The paper had been crushed
and flung away, as though the writer, on mature
thought, had resolved not to address me by letter.
I had never seen Reggie's handwriting, but on
comparison with some entries in a note-book
found in his pocket, the police pronounced it to
be his.
</p>

<p>
What did he wish to tell me?
</p>

<p>
About an hour after midnight we sent up to
the Villa Fabron for Gerald, who returned in the
cab which conveyed our messenger.
</p>

<p>
When we told him the terrible truth he stood
open-mouthed, rooted to the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie dead!" he gasped.  "Murdered?"
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly," answered Ulrica.  "The mystery
is inexplicable, but with your aid we must
solve it."
</p>

<p>
"With my aid?" he cried.  "I fear I cannot
help you.  I know nothing whatever about it."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," I said.  "But now tell us,
what is your theory?  You were his best friend
and would therefore probably know if he had any
enemy who desired to wreak revenge upon him."
</p>

<p>
"He hadn't a single enemy in the world, to my
knowledge," Gerald answered.  "The motive of
the crime was robbery, without a doubt.  Most
probably he was followed from Monte Carlo by
someone who watched his success at the tables.
There are always some desperate characters among
the crowd there."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, then, that the murderer was
actually watching us ever since the afternoon?"
I inquired in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I think it most probable," he responded.
"At Monte Carlo there is a crowd of all sorts and
conditions of outsiders.  Many of them wouldn't
hesitate to commit murder for the sum which poor
Reggie had in his pockets."
</p>

<p>
"It's terrible!" ejaculated Ulrica.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he sighed, as his face grew heavy and
thoughtful; "this awful news has upset me quite
as much as it has you.  I have lost my best
friend."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will spare no effort to clear up
the mystery," I said, for I had rather liked the
poor boy ever since chance had first thrown us
together in London, and on the renewal of our
acquaintance a few days previously my estimate of
his character and true worth had considerably
improved.  It was appalling that he should be
thus struck down so swiftly, and in a manner so
strange.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I shall at once do all I can," he
declared.  "I'll see the police, and state all I
know.  If this had occurred in England, or in
America, there might be a chance of tracing the
culprit by the numbers of the bank-notes.  In
France, however, the numbers are never taken,
and stolen notes cannot be recovered.  However,
rest assured, both of you, that I'll do my very
best."
</p>

<p>
There was a tap at the door at that moment,
and opening it, I was confronted by a tall,
dark-bearded Frenchman, who explained that he was
an agent of police.
</p>

<p>
To him Gerald related all he knew regarding
poor Reggie's acquaintances and movements while
on the Riviera, and afterwards, in company with
the detective, he went to the rooms we had
abandoned, where he gazed for the last time upon
the dead face of his friend.
</p>

<p>
This tragic event had naturally cast a gloom
over both Ulrica and myself.  We were both
nervous and apprehensive, ever debating the
mysterious reason which caused Reggie to enter
out sitting-room in our absence.  Surely he had
some very strong motive, or he would not have
gone straight there and commenced that mysterious
letter of explanation.
</p>

<p>
As far as we could discern, his success at the
tables in the afternoon had not intoxicated him,
for, although young, he was a practised, unemotional
player, to whom gains and losses were alike&mdash;at
least, he displayed no outward sign of satisfaction
other than a broad smile when his winning
number was announced by the croupier.  No.  Of
the many theories put forward, that of Gerald
seemed the most sound, namely, that he had been
followed from Monte Carlo with evil intent.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Petit Niçois</i>, the <i>Eclaireur</i> and the <i>Phare du
Littoral</i> were next day full of "The Mystery of the
'Grand Hotel.'"  In the article we were referred
to as Mademoiselle Y&mdash;&mdash; and Mademoiselle
R&mdash;&mdash;, as is usual in French journalism, and
certainly the comments made by the three organs
in question were distinguished by undisguised
suspicion and sorry sarcasm.  The <i>Petit Niçois</i>, a
journal which has on so many recent occasions
given proof of its anti-English and anti-American
tone, declared its "disbelief of the story that the
deceased had won the large sum stated," and
concluded by urging the police to leave no stone
unturned in their efforts to discover the murderer,
who, it added, would probably be found within
the hotel.  This remark was certainly a pleasing
reflection to cast upon us.  It was as though the
journal believed that one of us had conspired to
murder him.
</p>

<p>
Gerald was furious, but we were powerless to
protect ourselves against the cruel calumnies of
such <i>torchons</i>.
</p>

<p>
The official inquiry, held next day, after the
<i>post-mortem</i> examination had been made, revealed
absolutely nothing.  Even the cause of death
puzzled the doctors.  There was a slight cut in
the corner of the mouth, so small that it might
have been accidentally caused while he had been
eating, and beyond a slight scratch behind the
left ear there was no abrasion of the skin&mdash;no
wound of any kind.  On the neck, however, were
two strange marks, like the marks of a finger and
a thumb, which pointed to strangulation, yet the
medical examination failed to establish that as a
fact.  He died from some cause which could not
be determined.  It might, indeed, the doctors
admitted, have been almost described as a natural
death, but for the fact that the notes were missing,
which pointed so very markedly to murder.
</p>

<p>
That same evening, as the winter sun was sinking
behind the Esterels, we followed the dead
man's remains to their resting-place in the English
cemetery, high up in the olive groves of
Caucade&mdash;perhaps one of the most beautiful and
picturesque burial-places in the world.  Winter and
summer it is always a blaze of bright flowers, and
the view over the olive-clad slope and the calm
Mediterranean beyond is one of the most charming
in all the Riviera.
</p>

<p>
The English chaplain of the Rue de France performed
the last rites, and then, turning sorrowfully
away, we drove back, full of gloomy thoughts, to
Nice.
</p>

<p>
The puzzling incident had crushed all gaiety from
our hearts.  I suggested that we should
immediately go on to Mentone, but Ulrica declared that
it was our duty to remain where we were and give
the police what assistance we could in aiding them
to solve what seemed an inscrutable mystery.  Thus
the days which followed were days of sadness and
melancholy.  We ate in our own room to avoid the
gaze of the curious, for all in Nice now knew the
tragic story, and as we passed in and out of the
hotel we overheard many whisperings.
</p>

<p>
As for myself, I had a double burden of sorrow.
In those hours of deep thought and sadness, I
reflected that poor Reggie was a man who might,
perhaps, have become my husband.  I did not
love him in the sense that the average woman
understands love.  He was a sociable companion,
clever, smart in dress and gait, and altogether one
of those easy men of the world who appeal strongly
to a woman of my own temperament.  When I
placed him in comparison with Ernest, however,
I saw that I could never have actually entertained
a real affection for him.  I loved Ernest with a
wild, passionate love, and all others were now,
and would ever be, as naught to me.  I cared not
that he had forsaken me in favour of that ugly,
tow-haired witch.  I was his.  I felt that I must
at all hazards see him again.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting at the open window one afternoon,
gazing moodily out upon the Square Massena, when
Ulrica suddenly said:
</p>

<p>
"Curious that we've seen nothing more of
Ernest.  I suppose, however, you've forgotten
him."
</p>

<p>
"Forgotten him!" I cried, starting up.  "I
shall never forget him&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
In that instant I seemed to see his dark, handsome
face before me, as of old.  It was in the golden blaze
of a summer sunset.  I heard his rich voice in my
ears.  I saw him pluck a sprig of jasmine, emblem
of purity, and give it to me, at the same time
whispering words of love and devotion.  Ah, yes, he
loved me then&mdash;he loved me!
</p>

<p>
I put up my hand to shut out the vision.  I
rose, and staggered.  Then I felt Ulrica's soft hand
upon my waist.
</p>

<p>
"Carmela!  Carmela!" she cried, "what's the
matter?  Tell me, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"You know," I answered hoarsely.  "You
know, Ulrica, that I love him!"  My voice was
choked within me, so deep was my distress.  "And
he is to marry&mdash;to marry that woman!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, take my advice and forget him," she
said lightly.  "There are lots of other men whom
you could love quite as well.  Poor Reggie, for
instance, might have filled his place in your heart.
He was charming&mdash;poor fellow!  Your Ernest
treated you as he has done all women.  Why make
yourself miserable and wear out your heart remembering
a past which it is quite unnecessary to recall.
Live, as I do, for the future, without mourning over
what must ever be bygones."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's all very well," I said sadly.  "But
I can't help it.  That woman loves him&mdash;every
woman loves him!  You yourself admired him long
ago."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  I admire lots of men, but I have
never committed the folly of loving a single
one."
</p>

<p>
"Folly!" I cried angrily.  "You call love
folly!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," she laughed.  "Do dry your
eyes, or you'll look an awful sight when Gerald
comes.  He said he would go for a walk with us
on the Promenade at four&mdash;and it's already
half-past three.  Come, it's time we dressed."
</p>

<p>
I sighed heavily.  Yes, it was true that Ulrica
was utterly heartless towards those who admired
her.  I had with regret noticed her careless
attitude times without number.  She was a smart
woman who thought only of her own good looks,
her own toilettes, her own conquests, and her own
amusements.  Men pleased her by their flattery,
and she therefore tolerated them.  She had told
me this long ago with her own lips, and had urged
me to follow her example.
</p>

<p>
"Ulrica," said I at last, "forgive me, forgive
me, but I am so unhappy.  Don't let us speak of
him again.  I will try and forget, indeed I will&mdash;I
will try to regard him as dead.  I forgot
myself&mdash;forgive me, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, forget him, there's a dear," she said,
kissing me.  "And now call Felicita, and let us
dress.  Gerald hates to be kept waiting, you
know," and carelessly she began humming the
refrain of the latest <i>chanson</i>:
</p>

CHAPTER V
<br><br>
DEALS WITH A MILLIONAIRE
</h3>

<p>
One evening, about ten days later, we dined at
old Benjamin Keppel's invitation at the Villa
Fabron.
</p>

<p>
Visitors to Nice know the great white mansion
well.  High up above the sea, beyond the Magnan,
it stands in the midst of extensive grounds, shaded
by date palms, olives and oranges, approached by
a fine eucalyptus avenue, and rendered light with
flowers, its dazzlingly white walls relieved by the
green <i>persiennes</i>, a residence magnificent even for
Nice&mdash;the town of princes.  Along the whole front
of the great place there runs a broad marble terrace,
from which are obtained marvellous views of
Nice, with the gilt-domed Jetée Promenade jutting
out into the azure bay, the old Château, Mont
Boron, and the snow-capped Alps on the left, while
on the right lies the valley of the Var, and that
romantic chain of dark purple mountains which lie
far away beyond Cannes, a panorama almost as
magnificent as that from the higher Corniche.
</p>

<p>
The interior was, we found, the acme of luxury
and comfort.  Everywhere was displayed the fact
that its owner was wealthy; none on entering so
splendid a home would have believed him to be
so simple in taste and so curiously eccentric in
manner.  Each winter he came to Nice in his
splendid steam-yacht, the <i>Vispera</i>, which was now
anchored as usual in Villefranche Harbour, and with
his sister, a small, wizen-faced old lady, and
Mr. Barnes, his secretary, he lived there from December
until the end of April.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica had met him several times in London, and
he greeted us both very affably.  He was, I found,
a queer old fellow.  Report had certainly not lied
about him, and I could hardly believe that this
absent-minded, rather ordinary-looking old fellow,
with disordered grey hair and beard and dark,
deep-set eyes, was Gerald's father, the great
Benjamin Keppel, late of Johannesburg.
</p>

<p>
Dinner, even though rather a stately affair, was
quite a pleasant function, for the old millionaire was
most unassuming and affable.  One of his eccentricities
displayed itself in his dress.  His dining-jacket
was old, and quite glossy about the back
and elbows; he wore a paper collar, his white tie
showed unmistakable signs of having done duty on
at least a dozen previous occasions, and across his
vest was suspended an albert chain, not of gold,
but of rusty steel.  There had never been any
pretence about Ben Keppel in his earlier days, as
all the world knew, and there was certainly none
in these days of his affluence.  He had amassed his
fabulous fortune by shrewdness and sheer hard
work, and he despised the whole of that chattering
little ring which calls itself Society.
</p>

<p>
Before I had been an hour in this man's society
I grew to like him for his honest plain-spokenness.
He possessed none of that sarcastic arrogance which
generally characterises those whose fortunes are
noteworthy, but in conversation spoke softly, with
a carefully cultivated air of refinement.  Not that
he was refined in the least.  He had gone to the
Transvaal as an emigrant from a little village
in Norfolk, and had succeeded in amassing the
third largest fortune in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
He sat at the head of the table in his great dining-room,
while Ulrica and myself sat on either hand.
As a matter of course our conversation turned upon
the mysterious death of poor Reggie, and we both
gave him the exact version of the story.
</p>

<p>
"Most extraordinary!" he ejaculated.  "Gerald
has already explained the painful facts to me.
There seems no doubt whatever that the poor
fellow was murdered for the money.  Yet, to me,
the strangest part of the whole affair is why he
should have left you so suddenly at the Hermitage.
If he changed the money for large notes, as we
may suppose he did, why didn't he return to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he must in the meantime have met
someone," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," he said.  "If the police could
but discover the identity of this friend, then I feel
convinced that all the rest would be plain sailing."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear guv'nor, the police hold the
theory that he didn't meet anyone until he arrived
at Nice," Gerald observed.
</p>

<p>
"The police here are a confounded set of idiots!"
cried the old millionaire.  "If it had occurred in
London, or Chicago, or even in Glasgow, they
would have arrested the murderer long before this.
Here, in France, there's too much confounded
<i>contrôle</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I expect if the truth were known," observed
Miss Keppel, in her thin, squeaky voice, "the
authorities of Monaco don't relish the idea that a
man may be followed and murdered after successful
play, and they won't help the Nice police at all."
</p>

<p>
"Most likely," her brother said.  "The police
of the Prince of Monaco are elegant blue and silver
persons, who look as though they would hesitate
to capture a prisoner for fear of soiling their white
kid gloves.  But surely, Miss Rosselli," he added,
turning to me, "the Nice police haven't let the
affair drop, have they?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say," I responded.  "The last I
saw of any of the detectives was a week ago.  The
man who called upon me then admitted that no
clue had, so far, been obtained."
</p>

<p>
"Then all I have to say is that it's a public
scandal!" Benjamin Keppel cried angrily.  "The
authorities here seem to entertain absolutely no
regard for the personal safety of their visitors.
It appears to me that in Nice year by year prices
have gone up until hotel charges have become
unbearable, and people are being driven away to
Algiers and Cairo.  And I don't blame them.
During these past two years absolutely no regard
has been paid by the Nice authorities to the
comfort of the visitors who bring them their
wherewithal to live.  Look at the state of the streets
this season!  They're all up for new trams, new
paving, new watermains and things, until they
are absolutely impassable.  Even the Promenade
des Anglais has been up!  Why they can't do it
in summer, when there are no visitors here, is a
mystery.  Again, within the last eight or ten
years the price of everything has doubled, while
the sanitary defects have become a disgrace.  Why,
down at Beaumettes there were, until quite recently,
houses which actually drained into a cave!  And
then they are surprised at an outbreak of typhoid!
The whole thing's preposterous!"
</p>

<p>
"An English newspaper correspondent who
had the courage to tell the truth about Nice was
served with a notice threatening his expulsion
from France!" observed Gerald.  "A nice way
to suppress facts!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! that's the French way," observed Ulrica,
with a laugh.  "It is, however, certain that if Nice
is to remain healthy and popular, there must be
some very radical changes."
</p>

<p>
"If there are not, I shall sell this place," said
the old millionaire decisively.  "I shall take the
newspaper correspondent's advice and pitch my
quarters in Cairo, where English-speaking visitors
are protected, properly treated, and have their
comfort looked after."
</p>

<p>
"Why not try San Remo?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"San Remo!" he cried, with an air of disgust.
"Why, it's the most snobbish place on the whole
Riviera.  The persons who have villas there are
mostly those whom we taboo in society at home.
One interesting person has had the audacity to
name his villa after a royal palace.  It's like a
fellow putting up 'Buckingham Palace' upon
his ten-roomed house at Streatham Hill.  No,
Miss Rosselli, save me from San Remo!  The
hotels there are ruinous, and mostly of the fourth
class, while the tradespeople are as rapacious
a set of sharks as can be found outside Genoa.
And the visitors are of that angular, sailor-hatted
type of tea and lawn-tennis Englishwoman who
talks largely at home of what she calls 'wintering
abroad,' and hopes by reason of a six-weeks'
stay in a cheap <i>pension</i>, shivering over an
impossible fire, to improve her social status on her
return to her own local surroundings.  San Remo,
dull, dear, and dreary, has ever been a ghastly
failure, and ever will be, as long as it is frequented
by its present <i>clientele</i> of sharks and spongers.
What the newspaper correspondent said about
Nice was the truth&mdash;the whole truth," he went
on.  "I know Nice as well as most people, and
I bear out every charge put forward.  The Riviera
has declined terribly these past five years.  Why,
the people here actually hissed the Union Jack
at the last Battle of Flowers!"
</p>

<p>
"Disgraceful!" said Ulrica, rather amused at
the old fellow's warmth.  "If Nice declines in the
popular favour, then the Niçois have only
themselves to blame."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Foreigners are looked upon here
as necessary evils, while in Italy, except on the
Riviera, they are welcomed.  I built this place
and spent a fairish sum upon it, but if things
don't improve, I'll sell it at auction and cart my
traps down to Sicily, or over to Cairo.  Upon
that I'm determined."
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor's disgusted," Gerald laughed
across to me.  "He's taken like this sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my boy, I am disgusted.  All I want in
winter is quiet, sunshine, and good air.  That's
what I come here for.  And I can get all that at
Palermo or Algiers, for in those places the air is
even better than here."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't so fashionable," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"To an old man like me it doesn't matter
whether a place is fashionable or not, my dear
Miss Rosselli," he said, with a serious look.  "I
leave all that sort of thing to Gerald.  He has
his clubs, his horses, his fine friends and all the
rest of it.  But all the people know Ben Keppel
of Johannesburg.  Even if I belonged to the most
swagger of the clubs and mixed in good society&mdash;among
lords and ladies of the aristocracy, I
mean&mdash;I'd still be the same.  I couldn't alter
myself as some of 'em try to do."
</p>

<p>
We laughed.  The old man was so blunt that
one could not help admiring him.  He had the
reputation of being niggardly in certain matters,
especially regarding Gerald's allowance; but, as
Ulrica had remarked, there were no doubt plenty
of people who would be anxious to lend money to
the millionaire's heir upon post-obits, so that,
after all, it didn't much matter.
</p>

<p>
If inclined to be economical in one or two
directions, he certainly kept a remarkably good
table; but although there were choice wines
for us, he drank only water.
</p>

<p>
When, with Gerald, he joined us in the great
drawing-room, he seated himself near me and
suddenly said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Miss Rosselli, whether you'd
like to remain here and gossip, or whether you'd
like to stroll round the place.  You are a woman,
and there may be something to interest you in
it."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted, I'm sure," I said, and
together we went forth to wander about the great
mansion, which all the world on the Riviera knows
as the home of the renowned Ben Keppel.
</p>

<p>
He showed me his library, the boudoirs which
were never occupied, the gallery of modern French
paintings, the Indian tea-room, and the great
conservatory whence we walked out upon the
terrace and looked down upon the lights of the
gay winter city lying at our feet, and at the flash
of white brilliance that ever and anon shot across
the tranquil sea, marking the dangerous headland
at Antibes.
</p>

<p>
The night was lovely&mdash;one of those bright and
perfect nights which occur so often on the Riviera
in January.  At sundown the air is always damp
and treacherous, but when darkness falls it is no
longer dangerous, even to those with extremely
delicate constitutions.
</p>

<p>
"How beautiful!" I ejaculated, standing at
his side and watching the great white moon slowly
rising from the sea.  "What a fairyland!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It is beautiful.  The Riviera is, I
believe, the fairest spot that God has created
on this earth," and then he sighed, as though
world-weary.
</p>

<p>
Presently, when we had been chatting a few
minutes, he suggested that we should re-enter the
house, as he feared that I, being décolletée, might
catch a chill.
</p>

<p>
"I have a hobby," he said; "the only thing
which prevents me from becoming absolutely
melancholy.  Would you care to see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do show it me!" I said, at once interested.
</p>

<p>
"Then come with me," he exclaimed.  He
led me through two long passages to a door which
he unlocked with a tiny master-key upon his
chain.  "This is my private domain," he laughed.
"No one is allowed in here, so you must consider
yourself very highly privileged."
</p>

<p>
"That I certainly do," I responded.
</p>

<p>
As he entered he switched on the electric light,
displaying to my astonished gaze a large place
fitted as a workshop with lathes, tools, wheels,
straps and all sorts of mechanical contrivances.
</p>

<p>
"This room is secret," he said, with a smile.
"If the fine people who sometimes patronise me
with visits thought that I actually worked here
they'd be horrified."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you actually work?" I inquired,
surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  Having nothing to occupy my
leisure moments after I had severed myself from
the works, I took to turning.  I was a turner
by trade years ago, you know."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him in wonderment.  People had
said he was eccentric, and this was evidently one
of his eccentricities.  He had secretly
established a great workshop within that princely
mansion:
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to see how I can work?"
he asked, noticing my look of wonder.  "Well,
watch&mdash;excuse me."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon he threw off his jacket, and having
raised a lever which set one of the lathes at work,
he seated himself at it, selected a piece of ivory,
and placed it in position.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he laughed, looking towards me, "what
shall I make you?  Ah, I know, an object useful
to all you ladies&mdash;a box for your powder-puff,
eh?"
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be fully aware of feminine
mysteries, Mr. Keppel," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, I was married once," he
answered.  "But in them days my poor Mary
didn't want face-powder, bless her!"
</p>

<p>
And that instant his keen chisel cut deeply
into the revolving ivory with a harsh sawing
sound that rendered further conversation
impossible.
</p>

<p>
I stood behind and watched him.  His grand
old head was bent keenly over his work as he
hollowed out the box to the desired depth, carefully
gauged it, finished it, and quickly turned
the lid until it fitted with precision and
exactness.  Then he rubbed it down, polished it in
several ways, and at last handed it to me complete.
</p>

<p>
"This is a little souvenir, Miss Rosselli, of your
first visit to me."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you ever so much," I answered, taking
it and examining it curiously.
</p>

<p>
Truly he was a skilled workman, this man
whose colossal wealth was remarkable, even among
England's many millionaires.
</p>

<p>
"I only ask one favour," he said, as we passed
out and he locked the door of his workshop behind
us.  "That you will tell no one of my hobby&mdash;that
I have returned to my own trade.  For
Gerald's sake I am compelled to keep up an
appearance, and some of his friends would sneer
if they knew that his father still worked and
earned money in his odd moments."
</p>

<p>
"Do you earn money?" I inquired, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  A firm in Bond Street buy all
my ivory work, only they're not, of course, aware
that it comes from me.  It wouldn't do, you
know.  My work, you see, provides me with a
little pocket-money.  It has done so ever since I
left the factory," he added simply.
</p>

<p>
"I promise you, Mr. Keppel, that I'll tell no
one, if you wish it to remain a secret.  I had no
idea that you actually sold your turnings."
</p>

<p>
"You don't blame me, surely?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," I answered.
</p>

<p>
It seemed, however, ludicrous that this
multi-millionaire, with his great house in Park Lane,
his shooting-box in Scotland, his yacht, which
was acknowledged to be one of the finest afloat,
and his villa there on the Riviera, should toil at
turning, in order to make a pound or two a week
as pocket-money.
</p>

<p>
"When I worked as a turner in the old days,
I earned sixteen shillings a week, by making
butter dishes and bread plates, wooden bowls,
salad spoons, and such like, and I earn about
the same to-day when I've paid for the ivory,
and the necessary things for the 'shop,'" he
explained.  Then he added: "You seem to think
it strange, Miss Rosselli.  If you place yourself
for a moment in my position, that of a man
without further aim or ambition, you will not be
surprised that I have, after nearly forty years,
returned to the old trade to which I served my
apprenticeship."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand," I responded, "and I
only admire you that you do not, like so many
other rich men, lead a life of easy indolence."
</p>

<p>
"I can't do that," he said; "it isn't in me to
be still.  I must be at work, or I'm never happy.
Only I have to be discreet for Gerald's sake,"
and the old millionaire smiled, though rather
sadly, I thought.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
PLACES ME IN A PREDICAMENT
</h3>

<p>
"I think him a most sociable old fellow," I
answered, in response to Ulrica's inquiry when we
returned to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
"But awfully eccentric," she said.  "Gerald
always complains that he finds it impossible to
make both ends meet upon his allowance."
</p>

<p>
"He may surely be forgiven that," I said.
"After all, he's an excellent type of the prosperous
worker."
</p>

<p>
"He showed you his ivory-turning, I suppose?"
she observed, with a slight sneer.  "I see he's
given you a puff-box."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he turned it while I waited."
</p>

<p>
"It's really absurd," she declared, "that a
man of his enormous means should still continue
to work as he does.  Gerald tells me that he has
secret workshops in all his houses, and spends
the greater part of his time in turning, just as
any workman would do.  No doubt he's a bit
wrong in the head.  His wealth has crushed
him."
</p>

<p>
"I think you judge him too harshly, my dear,"
I responded.  "All master-minds have their
hobbies.  His hobby is quite a harmless one;
merely to return to the trade to which he was
apprenticed long ago."
</p>

<p>
She smiled with some sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
Then we parted, and retired to bed.
</p>

<p>
Day by day for many days we went over to
Monte Carlo; why I can scarcely tell.  All visitors
to Nice drift there, as if by the natural law of
gravitation, and we were no exception.  Even
though our memories of the Sign of the Seven
Sins were painful on account of poor Reggie's
mysterious death, we nevertheless found distraction
in the Rooms, the crowds, and the music.  Sometimes
Gerald would act as our escort, and at others
we went over alone after luncheon and risked
half-a-dozen louis at the tables with varying success.
We met quite a host of people we knew, for the
season was proceeding apace, and the nearness of
the Carnival attracted our compatriots from all
over Europe.
</p>

<p>
And as the days passed, my eyes were ever
watchful.  Truth to tell, Monte Carlo had an
attraction for me, not because of its picturesqueness
or its play, but because I knew that in that feverish
little world there lived and moved the man who
held my future in his hands.  In the Rooms, in
the "Paris," in the Place, and in the Gardens I
searched for sight of him, but alas! always in vain.
I bought the various visitors' lists, but failed to
discover that he was staying at any of the villas or
hotels.  Yet I knew he was there, for had I not seen
him with my own eyes&mdash;had I not seen him smile
upon the woman who was my rival?
</p>

<p>
The papers continued to comment upon the
mystery surrounding poor Reggie's tragic death,
yet beyond a visit from the British Consul, who
proved to be a nice old gentleman, and who
obtained a statement from us regarding his friends
in London, and who took possession of certain
effects found in his room, absolutely nothing fresh
transpired.
</p>

<p>
It was early in February, that month when Nice
puts on its annual air of gaiety in preparation for
the reign of the King of Folly; when the streets are
bright with coloured decoration, great stands are
erected in the Place Massena, and the shops of the
Avenue de la Gare are ablaze with Carnival costumes
in the two colours previously decided upon by the
Committee.  Though Nice may be defective from
a sanitary point of view, and her authorities churlish
towards foreign visitors, nevertheless in early
February it is certainly the gayest and most
charming spot on the whole Riviera.  The very
streets, full of life and movement, are sweet with the
perfume of roses, violets and mimosa; and at a
time when the rest of Europe is held frost-bound,
summer costumes and sunshades are the mode,
while men wear their straw hats and flannels upon
that finest of all sea-walks, the palm-planted
Promenade des Anglais.
</p>

<p>
Poor Reggie's brother, a doctor in Aberdeen, had
arrived to obtain a personal account of the mystery,
which, of course, we gave.  Gerald also conducted
him to the grave in the English cemetery, on which
he laid a beautiful wreath, and, while there, gave
orders for a handsome monument.  Then after
remaining three days, he returned to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, we became frequent guests at the
Villa Fabron, dining there often, and being always
received cordially by the old millionaire.  The
secretary, Barnes, appeared to me to rule the household,
for he certainly placed himself more in evidence
than ever did his employer, and I could see that
the relations between Gerald and this factotum
of his father were somewhat strained.  He was a
round-faced man of about thirty-five, dark,
clean-shaven, with a face that was quite boyish-looking,
but with a pair of small eyes that I did not like.
I always distrust persons with small eyes.
</p>

<p>
From his manner, however, I gathered that he
was a shrewd, hard-headed man of business, and
even Gerald himself had to admit that he fulfilled
the duties of his post admirably.  Of course, I
came into contact with him very little.  Now and
then we met on the Promenade, or in the Quai
St. Jean Baptiste, and he raised his hat in passing,
or he might happen to encounter us at the Villa
when we visited there, but save on these occasions, I
had not spoken to him a dozen words.
</p>

<p>
"He has the face of a village idiot, with eyes like
a Scotland Yard detective," was Ulrica's terse
summary of his appearance, and it was an admirable
description.
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday afternoon when the first Battle of
Confetti was fought, we went out in our satin
dominoes of mauve and old gold&mdash;the colours of
that year&mdash;and had glorious fun pelting all and
sundry with paper confetti, or whirling serpentines
among the crowd in the Avenue de la Gare.  Those
who have been in Nice during Carnival know the
wild gaiety of that Sabbath, the procession of
colossal cars and grotesque figures, the ear-splitting
bands, the ridiculous costumes of the maskers, the
buoyant fun and the good humour of everybody in
that huge cosmopolitan crowd.
</p>

<p>
Gerald was with us, as well as a young American
named Fordyce, whom we had known in London,
and who was now staying at the Beau Site, over
at Cannes.  With our sacks containing confetti slung
over our shoulders, and the hoods of our bright
dominoes over our heads, and wearing half masks
of black velvet, we mixed with the crowd the whole
of that afternoon, heartily enjoying the fun.
</p>

<p>
I confess that I enjoyed, and shall always, I hope,
enjoy the Nice Carnival immensely.  Many constant
visitors condemn it as a tawdry tinsel show, and
leave Nice for a fortnight in order to escape the
uproar and boisterous fun; but after all, even
though the air of recklessness would perchance
shock some of the more puritanical in our own land,
there is nevertheless an enormous amount of
harmless and healthy amusement to be derived from it.
It is only sour spinsters and the gouty who really
object to Carnival.  Regular visitors to the Riviera
condemn it merely because it is good form to
condemn everything vulgar.  They used to enjoy it
until its annual repetition became wearisome.
</p>

<p>
After the fight with confetti, during which our
hair and dominoes got sadly tumbled, we struggled
through the crowd to the hotel; and while Gerald
went along to the café outside the Casino to wait for
us, we dressed.
</p>

<p>
Felicita was an unconscionable time in doing my
hair&mdash;her head was full of the Carnival fever, I
think&mdash;and when I entered our sitting-room I found
Ulrica, ready dressed, seated on a low stool in a
picturesque attitude, lazily cooling herself with her
fan of feathers.  The disengaged bare arm, with
its jingling bangles, was gracefully raised, the taper
fingers were endeavouring, without much success,
to adjust a stray lock of hair.  It was a favourite
gesture of Ulrica's, for her hands were lovely, white and
slender, and covered with rings, which she was
fond of displaying.  The rosy light from the shaded
lamp fell kindly upon her, so that she made an
extremely pretty picture.
</p>

<p>
She was talking as I entered, and in the dim
light I discovered a man sitting on the ottoman.
I was about to retreat, when she recalled me, and
introduced me with a little laugh, to Cecil Ormrod,
who had called at that rather inconvenient moment.
She appeared to be by no means displeased at
having been surprised in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with him.
It was a notification that she had pegged out
her claim.
</p>

<p>
He was tall, manly, and well-shaped, and his
voice was pleasant.  Ulrica looked at me with a
curious smile, as if to say: "Don't you think I
have shown good taste?"  Then holding out her
hand for his aid in rising, she said to him:
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Ormrod, but we are just
going out to dinner.  I know you'll excuse us.
You'll look in and see us to-morrow.  You must,
you know&mdash;you're staying at the 'Anglais,' and
it's close by."
</p>

<p>
Then, turning to me, she added:
</p>

<p>
"Come, dear, we must make haste.  It's awfully
late, and old Mr. Keppel will never forgive us if the
soup comes up cold."
</p>

<p>
So young Cecil Ormrod made his adieux and
departed, promising to call on us again.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil is an awfully nice boy," Ulrica remarked.
"I met him at a country house-party two years
ago.  His father is a stockbroker and his sisters
are particularly jolly.  We must be nice to
him."
</p>

<p>
"You've already begun," I remarked, rather
spitefully perhaps.  But she only smiled.
</p>

<p>
Then we descended by the lift and joined Gerald,
whom we found walking up and down impatiently
in the hall.
</p>

<p>
Quite a host of smart people dined at the Villa
Fabron that evening, including several pretty
English girls.  A millionaire never lacks friends.
Old Benjamin Keppel was something of a recluse.
It was not often that he sent out so many invitations,
but when he gave a dinner he spared no expense,
and the one in honour of Carnival was truly a
gastronomic marvel.  The table was decorated
with mauve and old gold, the Carnival colours;
and the room, which was draped with satin of
the same shades, presented a mass of blended hues
particularly striking.
</p>

<p>
The old millionaire, seated at the head of his
table, in his breezy, open-hearted manner made
everyone happy at once.
</p>

<p>
Both Ulrica and I wore new frocks, which we
considered were the latest triumphs of our Nice
<i>couturière</i>&mdash;they certainly ought to have been, if
they were not, for their cost was ruinous&mdash;and
there were also quite a number of bright dresses and
good-looking men.  The day is gone, I am glad to
say, when a mode, because it is decreed to be the
fashion, is blindly adopted.  Women realise at
last that to achieve the happiest results they must
make Fashion subservient to their requirements,
instead of foolishly following in her wake, as for
years they have been wont to do.
</p>

<p>
As I sat there amid the gay chatter of the table,
I looked at the lean, grey-bearded man at its head,
and fell into reflection.  How strange it was that
this man, worth millions, actually toiled in secret
each day at his lathe to earn a few shillings a week
from an English firm as pocket-money!  All his
gay friends who sat around his table were ignorant
of that fact.  He only revealed it to those in whom
he placed trust&mdash;and I was one of the latter.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we all went forth into the gardens,
which were illuminated everywhere with coloured
lights and lanterns, and wandered beneath the
orange trees, joking and chattering.
</p>

<p>
A rather insipid young prig was at first my
companion, but presently I found myself beside old
Mr. Keppel, who walked at my side far down the
slope, till at last we came to the dark belt of olives
which formed the boundary of his domain.  Villas
on the Riviera do not usually possess extensive
grounds, but the Villa Fabron was an exception,
for the gardens ran down almost to the well-known
white sea-road that leads along from Nice to the
mouth of the Var.
</p>

<p>
"How charming!" I exclaimed, as, turning
back, we gazed upon the long terrace hung with
Japanese lanterns, and the moving figures smoking,
taking their coffee, and chattering.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the old man laughed.  "I have to be
polite to them now and then; but after all, Miss
Rosselli, they don't come here to visit me&mdash;only
to spend a pleasant evening.  Society expects me
to entertain, so I have to.  But I confess that
I never feel at home among all these folk, as Gerald
does."
</p>

<p>
"I fear you are becoming just a little world-weary,"
I said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Becoming?  Why, I was tired of it all years
ago," he answered, glancing at me with a serious
expression in his deep-set eyes.  It seemed as though
he wished to confide in me, and yet dared not do so.
</p>

<p>
"Why not try a change?" I suggested.  "You
have the <i>Vispera</i> lying at Villefranche.  Why not
take a trip in her up the Mediterranean?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he sighed.  "I hate yachting, for I have
nothing on board wherewith to occupy my time.
After a couple of days I always go ashore at the
nearest port.  The trip round from Portsmouth
here each winter is always a misery to me."
</p>

<p>
"And you keep such a beautiful craft idle!"
I observed, in a tone of reproach.
</p>

<p>
"You've seen it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Gerald took us on board a few days ago,
and showed us over.  It's like a small Atlantic
liner."
</p>

<p>
"Everyone says she's a handsome boat," the
old fellow remarked carelessly.  Then he added:
"Are you fond of the sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Passionately.  I always regret when the
Channel passage is finished."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would like to go on a cruise in the
<i>Vispera</i>?" he said.  "If you would, I should be
very pleased to take you.  I might invite a party for
a run, say, to Naples or Smyrna and back."
</p>

<p>
"I should be delighted," I answered enthusiastically,
for yachting was one of my favourite pastimes,
and on board such a magnificent craft, one of the
finest private vessels afloat, life would be most
enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I'll see what I can arrange," he
answered; and then we fell to discussing other
things.
</p>

<p>
He smoked thoughtfully as he strolled beside me,
his mind evidently much preoccupied.  The stars
were bright overhead, the night balmy and still, and
the air was heavy with the scent of flowers.  It was
hard to believe that it was actually mid-winter.
</p>

<p>
"I fear," he said at last&mdash;"I fear, Miss Rosselli,
that you find me a rather lonely man, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"You have no reason to be lonely," I responded.
"Surrounded by all these friends, your life might
surely be very gay if you wished."
</p>

<p>
"Friends?  Bah!" he cried, in a tone of
ridicule.  "There's an attraction in money that
is irresistible.  These people here, all of them,
bow down before the golden calf.  Sometimes,
Miss Rosselli, I have thought that there's no real
honesty of purpose in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you are a bit of a cynic," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And if I am, may I not be forgiven?" he
urged.  "I can assure you I find life very dull
indeed."
</p>

<p>
It was a strange confession coming from the lips
of such a man.  If I had only a sixteenth part of
his wealth I should, I reflected, be a very happy
woman&mdash;unless the common saying were actually
true, that great wealth only creates unbearable
burdens.
</p>

<p>
"You are not the only one who finds life wearisome,"
I observed frankly, "I also have to plead
guilty to the indictment on many occasions."
</p>

<p>
"You?" he cried, halting, and regarding me
in surprise.  "You&mdash;young, pretty, vivacious,
with ever so many men in love with you?  And
you are tired of it all&mdash;tired of it while still in your
twenties?  Impossible!"

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
MAINLY CONCERNS THE OWL
</h3>

<p>
Late that night Ulrica made merry at my expense.
She had noticed me walking <i>tête-à-tête</i> with old
Mr. Keppel, and accused me of flirtation with him.
</p>

<p>
Now, I may be given to harmless frivolities with
men of my own age, but I certainly have never
endeavoured to attract those of maturer years.
Elderly men may have admired me&mdash;that I do not
deny&mdash;but assuredly this has been through no
fault of my own.  A woman's gowns are always
an object of attention among the sterner sex.  If,
therefore, she dresses smartly she can at once
attract a certain section of males, even though her
features may be the reverse of prepossessing.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, a woman's natural <i>chic</i>, her taste
in dress and her style of <i>coiffure</i>, are by far the
most important factors towards her well-being.
The day of the healthful, buxom, pink-and-white
beauty is long past.  The woman rendered artistic
by soft chiffons, dainty blouses, and graceful
tea-gowns reigns in her stead.  Women nowadays
are becoming very Continental.  For instance,
certain illustrated journals tell us that fur coats
of every description are to be the mode, and a few
foolish women think that if they possess such a
garment, no matter what its shape, so long as it
is of fur, they will be in the vanguard of Fashion!
The really smart woman will, however, think twice
before she hides her figure by any such bulky
covering, merely because she happens to possess
the fur, and it will take the furrier all the ingenuity
at his command to produce the neat, short and
close-fitting little coat or bolero which she would
condescend to wear.  Yes, we are yearly becoming
more and more tasteful&mdash;more Parisian.  Ulrica's
suggestion caused me to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Old Mr. Keppel walked with me because he
wanted company, I suppose," I protested.  "I
had no idea such a misconstruction would be
placed upon our conversation, Ulrica."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear, everyone noticed it and
remarked upon it.  He neglected his guests and
walked with you for a whole hour in the garden.
Whatever did you find to talk about all that long
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I responded simply.  "He only took
me round the place.  I don't think he cares very
much for the people he entertains, or he wouldn't
have neglected them in that manner."
</p>

<p>
"No.  But I heard some spiteful things said
about yourself," Ulrica remarked.
</p>

<p>
"By whom?"
</p>

<p>
"By various people.  They said that you had
been angling after the old man for a long
time&mdash;that you had followed him to Nice, in fact."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ulrica!" I cried indignantly.  "How can
they say such things?  Why, you know it was
yourself who introduced us."
</p>

<p>
"I know," she answered rather curtly.  "But
I didn't expect that you'd make such a fool of
yourself as you've done to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I am not aware that I have made a fool of
myself, as you choose to term it," I responded
warmly.  "Mr. Keppel invited me to walk in the
garden, and as his guest I could not very well
refuse."
</p>

<p>
"You know what an ill-bred, vulgar old fellow
he is, and you might therefore have had some
respect for his guests."
</p>

<p>
"I know that he is an honest, plain-spoken man,"
I said calmly.  "He may be ill-bred, but,
nevertheless, he's more the gentleman than half the
over-dressed cads who so perpetually hang about
us just because we happen to be both good-looking."
</p>

<p>
"If I were in your place I should be ashamed
at having made such an exhibition of myself!"
she exclaimed, with bitter sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"I have made no exhibition of myself," I
protested.  "I like Mr. Keppel for his blunt
manliness&mdash;but beyond that&mdash;why, Ulrica, you must be
mad to suspect me of flirtation with him!"
</p>

<p>
"He's old enough to be your father," she snapped.
"Yet Doris Ansell whispered in the drawing-room
that she had watched him holding your hand in
lover-like attitude."
</p>

<p>
"Then Doris Ansell lied!" I exclaimed angrily.
"He never touched my hand.  It is a foul libel
upon him and upon me."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you myself walking with him."
</p>

<p>
"And you were walking with Gerald.  He was,
as usual, flirting with you," I said spitefully.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks crimsoned, and I saw that my words
had struck home.  How cruel and ill-natured was
such gossip as this; how harmful to my good name,
and to his.  I knew Doris Ansell well&mdash;a snub-nosed,
under-sized little gossip, and had always
believed that she entertained towards me some
ill-will&mdash;for what reason I never could ascertain.
</p>

<p>
"And why should you fly into such a rage?"
she inquired, with affected coolness.  "If you were
to change into Mrs. Ben Keppel you would at
least possess a very substantial income, even if
your husband was a rough diamond.  You would
exact the envy of half the women we know, and
surely that's quite sufficient success to have
obtained.  One can't have everything in this world.
Money is always synonymous with ugliness where
marriage is concerned."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any object to be obtained by
discussing the matter further," I answered, with
rising indignation.  "Such a circumstance as you
suggest will never occur, you may depend upon it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Carmela," she said, laughing, "you are
still a child, I really declare!"
</p>

<p>
"I am old enough to be mistress of my own
actions," I answered quickly.  "I shall certainly
never marry for money."
</p>

<p>
"Because of Ernest&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"It is cruel, Ulrica, to taunt me like this!" I
cried, bursting into tears.  "Surely I've suffered
enough!  You do not suffer because, as you have
said hundreds of times, you have no heart.  Would
that I had none!  Love within me is not yet dead.
Would to God it were!  I might then be like you,
cold and cynical, partaking of the pleasures of the
world without a thought of its griefs.  As I am, I
must love.  My love for that man is my very
life!  Without it I should die!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, my dear," she said quickly, in kinder
tones.  "Don't cry, or your eyes will be a horrid
sight to-morrow.  Remember we're lunching over
at Beaulieu with the Farnells.  Come, dry your
eyes and go to bed.  I didn't mean anything, you
know."  And she drew down my head and kissed
me tenderly on the brow.
</p>

<p>
I left her and went to my room, but her words
rang constantly in my ears.  The idea that the
old millionaire had been attracted by me was a
novel one.  Surely that could not be possible.
True, he had grown confidential enough to tell
me things that were held secret from all his friends,
yet I attributed this to his eccentricity.
</p>

<p>
No, it was surely not true that he was among
my admirers.  Through the dark hours of that
night I thought it all over.  Sometimes I saw in
all that had occurred a disposition on his part to
tell me some secret or other.  He had been so
preoccupied, and had so earnestly told me of
the dull loneliness of his life, that colour was
certainly lent to the theory that he looked upon me
with affection.  Yet, after all, I reasoned with
myself that I could never in my life love a man
of that age, and determined never to barter myself
for money and position.  I should even, if he told
me the truth, be compelled to refuse his offer.
</p>

<p>
But the whole theory was ridiculous.  It had
been started by that lying, ill-natured woman
for want of something else to gossip about.  Why
should I heed it?  I liked him, it was true, but I
could never love him&mdash;never!
</p>

<p>
Reader, you may think it strange that we two
young women were wandering about the Continent
together without any male relative.  The truth is,
that terrifying personage, so peculiarly British,
known as Mrs. Grundy, is dead.  It is her complete
downfall in this age of emancipation, bicycles and
bloomers, that more than anything else makes
the modern spinster's lot, in many respects, an
eminently attractive one.
</p>

<p>
We were discussing this over our coffee on the
following morning, when Ulrica, referring to our
conversation of the previous night, said:
</p>

<p>
"Formerly girls married in order to gain their
social liberty; now they more often remain single
to bring about that desirable consummation."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I acquiesced.  "If we are permitted
by public opinion to go to college, to live
alone, to travel, to have a profession, to belong
to a club, to wear divided skirts&mdash;not that I approve
of them&mdash;to give parties, to read and discuss
whatsoever seems good to us, and go to theatres,
and even to Monte Carlo, without a masculine escort,
then we have most of the privileges&mdash;and several
others thrown in&mdash;for which the girl of twenty or
thirty years ago was ready to sell herself to the
first suitor who offered himself and the shelter of
his name."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very glad, my dear Carmela, that you are
at last becoming so very sensible," she answered
approvingly.  "Until now you've been far too
romantic and too old-fashioned in your ideas.  I
really think that I shall convert you to my views
of life in time&mdash;if you don't marry old Keppel."
</p>

<p>
"Kindly don't mention him again," I protested
firmly.  "To a certain extent I entirely agree with
you regarding the emancipation of woman.  A
capable woman who has begun a career, and feels
certain of advancement in it, is often as shy of
entangling herself matrimonially as ambitious
young men have ever shown themselves in like
circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Without doubt.  The disadvantages of marriage
to a woman with a profession are more obvious
than to a man, and it is just the question of
maternity, with all its duties and responsibilities,
which is occasionally the cause of many women
forswearing the privileges of the married state."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ulrica," I said, "speaking candidly,
would you marry if you had a really good offer?"
</p>

<p>
"Marry?  Certainly not," she answered, with
a laugh, as though the idea were perfectly
preposterous.  "Why should I marry?  I've had a
host of offers, just as every woman with a little
money always has.  But why should I renounce
my freedom?  If I married, my husband would
forbid this and forbid that&mdash;and you know I
couldn't live without indulging in my little pet
vices of smoking and gambling."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't your husband's love fill the void?"
I queried.
</p>

<p>
"It would be but a poor substitute, I'm afraid.
The most ardent love nowadays cools within six
months, and more often even wanes with the
honeymoon."
</p>

<p>
"I've really no patience with you," I said hastily.
"You're far too cynical."
</p>

<p>
She smiled, and then sighed gently.  She looked
so young in her pale pink <i>peignoir</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Contact with the world has made me what
I am, my dear Carmela."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "to be quite candid, I don't
think that the real cause why so many women
nowadays remain single is to be found in the
theories we've been airing to one another.  The
fact is, after all, that we're only a bundle of nerves
and emotions, and once our affections are involved
we are capable of any heroism."
</p>

<p>
"You may be one of those, my dear," was her
rather grave response.  "I'm afraid, however, that
I am not."
</p>

<p>
I did not pursue the subject further.  She was
kind and sympathetic in all else, save where my
love was concerned.  My affection for Ernest was
to her merely an amusing incident.  She seemed
unable to realise how terribly serious I was, or
what a crushing blow had fallen upon me when he
had turned and forsaken me.
</p>

<p>
Gerald called at eleven, for he had arranged to
accompany us to Beaulieu.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rosselli," he cried, as he greeted me,
"you're a brick&mdash;that you are!"
</p>

<p>
"A brick!" I echoed.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, you've worked an absolute miracle with
the guv'nor.  Nobody else could persuade him
to set foot on the <i>Vispera</i> except to return to
England, yet you've induced him to arrange for a
cruise up the Mediterranean."
</p>

<p>
Ulrica glanced at me with a confident air.  I
knew the thought which rose in her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Are you glad?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Glad?  I should rather think so!  We shall
have a most glorious time!  He intends asking the
Farnells, Lord Eldersfield, Lord and Lady
Stoneborough, and quite a lot of people.  We've got
you to thank for it.  No power on earth would
induce him to put to sea&mdash;except yourself, Miss
Rosselli."
</p>

<p>
"No, Gerald," I said.  "Please don't flatter me.
It's bad form, you know.  Your father asked me if
I would like a cruise, and I responded in the
affirmative, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, at any rate, it's enough," answered the
young man enthusiastically.  "The guv'nor has
sent for Davis, the skipper, and when I left him,
was poring over a chart of the Eastern Mediterranean.
There's only one condition that I've made,
and I think you'll both agree with me."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" inquired Ulrica, as she buttoned
her glove.
</p>

<p>
"That we don't take that cur Barnes.  I hate
that fellow."
</p>

<p>
"So say all of us," Ulrica observed frankly.
</p>

<p>
"His air is so superior that people believe him
to be at least a son of the house," Gerald said
quickly.  "I know that he tells the guv'nor all
sorts of false tales about myself.  He knew that
I lost pretty heavily at Monte when I went over
with you the other night, and as Mr. Barnes
chanced to be there he was, of course, the amiable
gentleman who told the tale.  I always feel as
though I'd like to give him a good sound
kicking."
</p>

<p>
"Treat him with contempt," I urged.  "Your
father is not the kind of man to believe mere tales
without proof.  Even if he is a bit eccentric, he's
the essence of justice&mdash;that you'll admit."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Miss Rosselli, I tell you that my old dad
is the very best fellow in all the world.  I know all
men of his stamp have their little eccentricities,
and therefore forgive him.  If he's niggardly
towards me, it's only because he doesn't believe in
a young man going the pace too fast."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," I answered, remembering how very
lenient the world is towards the son of a millionaire.
"No man should speak ill of his father&mdash;more
especially of such an admirable type as your father
is."
</p>

<p>
But I drew myself up short, for I saw a smile
playing in the corners of Ulrica's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Let's be off," she said.  "We'll take a fiacre
to the station.  Gerald, tell them to get us a cab."
</p>

<p>
And young Keppel went forth to do her bidding.
</p>

<p>
The Carnival <i>bal masqué</i> at the Casino&mdash;the great
event of King Carnival's reign&mdash;took place on the
following Sunday night, and we made up a gay
party to go to it.  There were seven of us, and
we looked a grotesque group as we assembled in the
vestibule of the "Grand," attired in our fantastic
costumes and wearing those mysterious masks of
black velvet which so effectively conceal the
features.  Ulrica represented a Watteau shepherdess,
with wig and crook complete, while I was
<i>en bébé</i>, wearing a simple costume, surmounted
by a sun-bonnet with a very wide brim.  One of
the women of the party was a Queen of Folly,
and another wore a striking Louis XV. dress;
while Gerald represented a demon, and wore pins
in his tail in order to prevent others from pulling
that appendage.
</p>

<p>
As the distance from the hotel to the Casino was
only a few hundred yards, we walked.  Laughter
was abundant, for the novelty of the thing was
sublime.  Among our party only Gerald had
witnessed a previous Carnival ball, and he had led
us to expect a scene of wild merriment.
</p>

<p>
Certainly we were not disappointed.  Having
run the gauntlet of a crowd who smothered us
with confetti, we entered the great winter-garden
of the Casino, and found it a blaze of colour&mdash;the
two colours of Carnival.  Suspended from the high
glass roof were thousands of bannerettes of mauve
and gold, while the costumes of the revellers were of
the self-same shades.  Everywhere flashed coloured
lights of similar hue, and the fun was already
fast and furious.  The side-rooms, which, as most
readers will remember, are ordinarily devoted to
gambling&mdash;for gambling in a mild form is permitted
at Nice&mdash;were now turned into handsome supper-rooms,
and in the winter-garden and the theatre
beyond the scene was perhaps one of the liveliest
and most enchanting in the whole world.
</p>

<p>
Everyone had gone there for full enjoyment.  In
the theatre there was wild dancing; the boxes were
filled by the <i>grand monde</i> of Europe, princes and
princesses, grand-dukes and grand-duchesses, counts
and countesses, noted actresses from Paris and
London, and well-known people of every nationality,
all enjoying the scene of uproarious merrymaking.
We viewed it first from our own box, but at length
someone suggested that we should descend and
dance, an idea which at once found ungrudging
favour.
</p>

<p>
Masked as everyone was, with the little piece of
black lace tacked to the bottom of the black velvet
<i>loup</i>, in order to conceal the lower part of the
features, it was impossible to recognise a single
person in that whirling crowd.  Therefore,
immediately we descended to the floor of the theatre we
at once became separated.  I stood for a few
moments bewildered.  The blaze of colour made
one's head reel.  People in all sorts of droll costumes
were playing various kinds of childish antics.
Out in the winter-garden clowns and devils were
playing leap-frog, and sylphs and angels, joining
hands, were whirling round and round in huge rings,
playing some game and screaming with laughter.
Almost everyone carried miniature representations
of Punch, with bells attached, large rattles, or
paper flowers which, when blown, could be elongated
to a ridiculous extent.
</p>

<p>
Never before, in all my life, had I been amidst such
a merry and irresponsible crowd.  The ludicrousness
of Carnival reaches its climax in the ball at the
Casino, and whatever may be said of it, it is without
doubt one of the annual sights of Europe.  I had
heard it denounced as a disgraceful exhibition by
old ladies, who had been compelled to admit that
they had never been present; but I must say that
from first to last, although the fun was absolutely
unbridled, I saw nothing whatever to offend.
</p>

<p>
I was standing aside watching the dancers,
when suddenly a tall man, dressed in a remarkable
costume representing an owl, approached, and
bowing, said in rather good English, in a deep,
but not unmusical voice:
</p>

<p>
"Might I have the pleasure of this dance with
mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at him in suspicion.  He was a weird-looking
creature in his bird-dress of mauve and gold,
and the strange mask with two black eyes peering
out at me.  Besides, it was not my habit to dance
with strangers.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he laughed.  "You hesitate because we
have not been introduced.  Here in Nice at Carnival
one introduces oneself.  Well, I have introduced
myself, and now I ask you what is your opinion of
my marvellous get-up.  Don't you think me a real
fine bird?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I laughed.  "You're absolutely
hideous."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the compliment," he answered
pleasantly.  "To unmask is forbidden, or I'd
take off this terrible affair, for I confess I am half
stifled.  But if I'm ugly, you're absolutely charming.
It's a case of Beauty and the Bird.  Aren't my
wings fetching?"
</p>

<p>
"Very."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you were English.  Funny how we
Frenchmen can always pick out English and
Americans."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know I am English?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now that's a secret," he laughed.  "But
hark! it's a waltz.  Come under my wing, and
let's dance.  I know you'd dearly love a turn
round.  For this once throw the introduction farce
to the winds, and let me take you round.  The owl
is never a ferocious bird, you know."
</p>

<p>
For a moment I hesitated, then consenting, I
whirled away among the dancers with my unknown
partner.
</p>

<p>
"I saw you up in that box," he said presently.
"I was waiting for you to come down."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
With woman's innate coquetry, I felt a delight
in misleading him, just as he was trying to mislead
me.  There was a decided air of adventure in
that curious meeting.  Besides, so many of the
dresses were absolutely alike that, now we had
become separated, it was hopeless for me to discover
any of our party.  The Nice dressmakers make
dozens of Carnival dresses exactly similar, and
when the wearers are masked, it is impossible to
distinguish one from the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said evasively, in answer to my
question, "I wanted a partner."
</p>

<p>
"And so you waited for me?  Surely any other
would have done as well?"
</p>

<p>
"No, that's just it.  She wouldn't.  I wanted
to dance with you."
</p>

<p>
The waltz had ended, and we strolled together
out of the theatre into the great winter-garden,
with its bright flower-beds and graceful palms&mdash;a
kind of huge conservatory, which forms a gay
promenade each evening in the season.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why you should entertain such a
desire," I said.  "Besides," and I paused to gain
breath for the little untruth, "I fear now that my
husband will be furious if he has noticed us."
</p>

<p>
"I might say the same about my wife&mdash;if I wished
to import fiction into the romance," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then you have no wife?" I suggested, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"My wife is just as real as your husband," he
responded bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that if you really have a husband, it
is an extremely surprising confession."
</p>

<p>
"Why surprising?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's true that husbands are like
Somebody's sewing-machines, no home being complete
without one," he laughed.  "But I really had no
idea that Mademoiselle Carmela Rosselli possessed
such a useful commodity."
</p>

<p>
"What!" I gasped, glaring at the hideous-looking
Owl.  "You know me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he responded, in a deeper tone, more
earnestly than before.  "I know quite well who
you are.  I have come here to-night expressly to
speak with you."
</p>

<p>
I started, and stood glaring at him in wonderment.
</p>

<p>
"I have," he added, in a low, confidential voice,
"something important to say to you&mdash;something
most important."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
NARRATES A MYSTERIOUS INCIDENT
</h3>

<p>
"You are a perfect stranger, sir," I said, with
considerable hauteur.  "Until you care to give me
your name, and make known who you are, I have
no wish to hear this important statement of yours."
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered, "I regret very much that
for certain reasons I am unfortunately unable
to furnish my name.  I am The Owl&mdash;that is
sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"No, not for me.  As I am not in the habit of
thus chattering with strangers at a public ball, I
must wish you good evening," I said, and turned
abruptly away.
</p>

<p>
In an instant he was again at my side.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Miss Rosselli," he said, in a deeply
earnest tone.  "You must listen to me.  I have
something to tell you which closely concerns
yourself&mdash;your future welfare."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot speak now, as someone may overhear.
I had to exercise the greatest precaution in
approaching you for there are spies everywhere, and
a single blunder would be fatal."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" I inquired, at once
interested.
</p>

<p>
The manner of this hideously disguised man
who spoke such excellent English was certainly
mysterious, and I could not doubt that he was in
real earnest.
</p>

<p>
"Let us walk over there, and sit in that corner,"
he said, indicating a seat half hidden in the bamboos.
"If there is no one near, I will explain.  If we are
watched, then we must contrive to find some other
place."
</p>

<p>
"In our box," I suggested.  "We can sit at
the back in the alcove, where no one can see us."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!" he answered.  "I never thought
of that.  But if any of your party return there?"
</p>

<p>
"I can merely say that you invited me to dance,
and I, in return, invited you there for a few
moments' rest.
</p>

<p>
"Then let's go," he said, and a few minutes
later we were sitting far back in the shadow of the
box on the second tier, high above the music and
gay revelry.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I inquired eagerly, when we were
seated, "and why did you wish to see me to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"First, I have knowledge&mdash;which you will not,
I think deny&mdash;that you loved a man in London&mdash;one
Ernest Cameron."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"And at this moment there is a second man who,
although not your lover, is often in your thoughts.
The man's name is Benjamin Keppel.  Am I
correct?"
</p>

<p>
"I really don't see by what right you submit
me to this cross-examination upon affairs which
only concern myself," I responded in a hard voice,
although I was eager to determine the identity
of this masked man.
</p>

<p>
"Marriage with a millionaire is a temptation
which few women can resist," he said philosophically,
in a voice undisturbed by my harsh retort.
"Temptations are the crises which test the strength
of one's character.  Whether a woman stands or
falls at these crises depends very largely on what
she is before the testing comes."
</p>

<p>
"And pray what concern have you in my intentions
or actions?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You will discover that in due time," he
answered.  "I know that to the world you, like your
companion, Ulrica Yorke, pretend to be a woman
who prefers her freedom and has no thought of love.
Yet you are only acting the part of the free woman.
At heart you love as intensely and hate as fiercely
as all the others.  Is not that so?"
</p>

<p>
"You speak remarkably plainly, as though you
were well acquainted with my private affairs," I
remarked resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"I only say what I know to be the truth," he
replied.  "You, Carmela Rosselli, are not heartless
like that emotionless woman who is your friend.
The truth is that you love&mdash;you still love Ernest
Cameron."
</p>

<p>
I rose in quick indignation.
</p>

<p>
"I refuse to hear you further, monsieur!" I
cried.  "Kindly let me pass."
</p>

<p>
His hand was on the door of the box, and he kept
it there, notwithstanding my words.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, quite coolly.  "You must hear
me&mdash;indeed, you shall hear me!"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard you," I answered.  "You have
said sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"I have not finished," he replied.  "When I
have done so, you will, I think, only be anxious to
learn more."  He added quite calmly: "If you will
kindly be seated, so as not to attract attention, I
will go on."
</p>

<p>
I sank back into my seat without further effort
to arrest his words.  The adventure was most
extraordinary, and certainly his grotesque
appearance held me puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Here, in Nice, not long ago," he continued,
"you met a man who believed himself in love with
you, yet a few nights later he was foully murdered
in your sitting-room at the hotel."
</p>

<p>
"Reginald Thorne," I said quickly, in a strained
voice, for the memory of that distressing event
was very painful.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Reginald Thorne," he repeated, in a low,
hoarse voice.
</p>

<p>
"You knew him?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I knew him," was his response, in a deep,
strange tone.  "It is to speak of him that I have
sought you to-night."
</p>

<p>
"If you are so well aware who I am, and of all
my movements, you might surely have called upon
me," I remarked dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no!  That would have been impossible.
None must know that we have met!"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because there are reasons&mdash;very strong reasons&mdash;why
our meeting should be kept secret," the voice
responded, the pair of sharp black eyes peering
forth mysteriously from the two holes in the owl's
face.  "We are surrounded by spies.  Here, in
France, they have reduced espionage to a fine art."
</p>

<p>
"And yet the police have failed to discover the
murderer of poor Mr. Thorne," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"They will never do that."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"They will never solve the mystery without aid."
</p>

<p>
"Whose aid?"
</p>

<p>
"Mine."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I cried, starting quickly.  "Are you
actually in possession of some fact that will lead
to the arrest of the culprit?  Tell me quickly.
Is it really certain that he was murdered, and did
not die a natural death?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he laughed.  "I told you a few minutes
ago that you would be anxious to hear my
statement.  Was I not correct?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  I had no idea that you were in
possession of any facts or evidence regarding the
crime.  What do you know about it?
</p>

<p>
"At present I am not at liberty to say&mdash;except
that the person who committed the deed was no
ordinary criminal."
</p>

<p>
"Then he was murdered, and the motive was robbery?"
</p>

<p>
"That was the police theory, but I can at once
assure you that they were entirely mistaken.
Theft was not the motive."
</p>

<p>
"But the money was stolen from his pockets!"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you prove that?  He might have
secreted it somewhere before the attack was made
upon him."
</p>

<p>
"I feel certain that the money was stolen," I
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are, of course, welcome to your own
opinion," he answered carelessly.  "I can only
assure you that, even though the money was not
found upon him, robbery was not the motive of
the crime."
</p>

<p>
"And you have come to me in order to tell me
that?" I said.  "Perhaps you will explain
further."
</p>

<p>
"I come to you, Miss Rosselli, because a serious
responsibility rests upon yourself."
</p>

<p>
"In what manner?"
</p>

<p>
"The unfortunate young man was attracted
towards you; he accompanied you to Monte
Carlo on the day of his death, and he was found
dead in your sitting-room."
</p>

<p>
"I know," I said.  "But why did he go there?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he, no doubt, wished to speak with
you."
</p>

<p>
"At that late hour?  I cannot conceive why
he should want to speak with me.  He might have
come to me in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"No.  The matter was pressing&mdash;very pressing."
</p>

<p>
"Then if you know its nature, as you apparently
do, perhaps you will tell me."
</p>

<p>
"I can do nothing," the deep voice responded.
"I only desire to warn you."
</p>

<p>
"To warn me!" I cried, surprised.  "Of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of a danger which threatens you."
</p>

<p>
"A danger?  Explain it."
</p>

<p>
"Then kindly give me your undivided attention
for a moment," the Owl said earnestly, at the
same time peering into my eyes with that air of
mystery which so puzzled me.  "Perhaps it will
not surprise you to know that in this matter of the
death of Reginald Thorne there are several interests
at stake, and the most searching and secret
inquiries have been made on behalf of the young
man's friends by detectives sent from London,
and from New York.  These inquiries have
established one or two curious facts, but so far from
elucidating the mystery, they have only tended
to render it more inscrutable.  As I have already
said, the person actually responsible for the crime
is no ordinary murderer, and notwithstanding the
fact that some of the shrewdest and most experienced
detectives have been at work, they can
discover nothing.  You follow me?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will proceed further.  Has it ever
occurred to you that you might, if you so desired,
become the wife of old Benjamin Keppel?"
</p>

<p>
"I really don't see what that has to do with the
matter under discussion," I said, with quick
indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Then you admit that old Mr. Keppel is among
your admirers?"
</p>

<p>
"I admit nothing," I responded.  "I see no
reason why you, a perfect stranger, should intrude
upon my private affairs in this manner."
</p>

<p>
"The intrusion is for your own safety," he
answered ambiguously.
</p>

<p>
"And what need I fear, pray?  You spoke of
some extraordinary warning, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"True, I wish to warn you," said the man in
strange disguise.  "I came here to-night at
considerable risk to do so."
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  Then, after a few moments of
reflection, I resolved upon making a bold shot.
</p>

<p>
"Those who speak of risk are invariably in
fear," I said.  "Your words betray that you have
some connection with the crime."
</p>

<p>
I watched him narrowly, and saw him start
perceptibly.  Then I congratulated myself upon
my shrewdness, and was determined to fence with
him further and endeavour to make him commit
himself.  I rather prided myself upon smart
repartee, and many had told me that at times I
shone as a brilliant conversationalist.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he said hastily, "I think you mistake
me, Miss Rosselli.  I am acting in your interests
entirely."
</p>

<p>
"If so, then surely you may give me your name
or tell me who you are."
</p>

<p>
"I prefer to remain unknown," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Because you fear exposure."
</p>

<p>
"I fear no exposure," he protested.  "I came
here to speak with you secretly to-night, because
had I called openly at your hotel my visit would
have aroused suspicion, and most probably have
had the effect of thwarting the plans of those who
are endeavouring to solve the enigma."
</p>

<p>
"But you give me no proof whatever of your
<i>bona fides</i>!" I declared.
</p>

<p>
"Simply because I am unable.  I merely come
to give you warning."
</p>

<p>
"Of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the folly of flirtation."
</p>

<p>
I sprang to my feet indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"You insult me!" I cried.  "I will bear it no
longer.  Please let me pass!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not allow you to leave until I have
finished," he answered determinedly.  "You think
that I am not in earnest, but I tell you I am.  Your
whole future depends upon your acceptance of
my suggestion."
</p>

<p>
"And what is your suggestion, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"That you should no longer regard old Mr. Keppel
as your possible husband."
</p>

<p>
"I have never regarded him as such," I responded,
with a contemptuous laugh.  "But supposing
that I did&mdash;supposing that he offered me
marriage, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Then a disaster would fall upon you.  It is
of that disaster that I came here to-night to warn
you," he said, speaking quickly in a hoarse voice.
"Recollect that you must never become his wife&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
"If I did, what harm could possibly befall me?"
I inquired eagerly, for the stranger's prophetic
words were, to say the least, exceedingly strange.
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a moment, then said slowly:
</p>

<p>
"Remember the harm that befell Reginald Thorne."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I cried in alarm.  "Death?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered solemnly, "death."
</p>

<p>
I stood before him for a moment breathless.
</p>

<p>
"Then, to put it plainly," I said, in an uneven
voice, "I am threatened with death should I marry
Benjamin Keppel?"
</p>

<p>
"Even to become betrothed to him would be
fatal," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"And by whom am I thus threatened?"
</p>

<p>
"That is a question I cannot answer.  I am
here merely to warn you, not to give explanations."
</p>

<p>
"But the person who takes such an extraordinary
interest in my private affairs must have
some motive for this threat?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I tell?  It is not myself who is
threatening you.  I have only given you warning."
</p>

<p>
"There is a reason, then, why I should not marry
Mr. Keppel?"
</p>

<p>
"There is even a reason why you should in
future refuse to accept his invitations to the Villa
Fabron," my strange companion replied.  "You
have been invited to form one of a party on board
the <i>Vispera</i>, but for your personal safety I would
presume to advise you not to go."
</p>

<p>
"I shall certainly please myself," I replied.
"These threats will certainly not deter me from
acting just as I think proper.  If I go upon a
cruise with Mr. Keppel and his son, I shall have no
fear of my personal safety."
</p>

<p>
"Reginald Thorne was young and athletic.
He had no fear.  But he disobeyed a warning.
You know the result."
</p>

<p>
"Then you wish me to decline Mr. Keppel's
invitation and remain in Nice?"
</p>

<p>
"I urge you, for several reasons, to decline his
invitation, but I do not suggest that you should
remain in Nice.  I am the bearer of instructions
to you.  If you carry them out, they will be
distinctly to your benefit."
</p>

<p>
"What are they?"
</p>

<p>
"To-day," he said, "is the 18th of February.
Those who have your welfare at heart desire that
you should, after the Riviera season is over, go
to London, arriving there on the 1st of June
next."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
This stranger seemed to possess a good deal of
knowledge in regard to my antecedents.
</p>

<p>
"Well, on arrival in London you will go to the
Hotel Cecil, and there receive a visitor on the
following day, the 2nd of June.  You will then be
given certain instructions, which must be carried
out."
</p>

<p>
"All this is very mysterious," I remarked.
"But I really have no intention of returning to
London until next autumn."
</p>

<p>
"I think you will," was his reply, "because,
when you fully consider all the circumstances,
you will keep the appointment in London, and learn
the truth."
</p>

<p>
"The truth regarding the death of Reginald
Thorne?" I cried.  "Cannot I learn it here?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied.  "And further, you will never
learn it unless you take heed of the plain words
I have spoken to-night."
</p>

<p>
"You tell me that any further friendship between
Mr. Keppel and myself is forbidden," I exclaimed,
laughing.  "Why, the whole thing is really too
absurd!  I shall, of course, just please
myself&mdash;as I always do."
</p>

<p>
"In that case, disaster is inevitable," he
observed, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"You tell me that I am threatened with death
if I disobey.  That is certainly extremely comforting."
</p>

<p>
"You appear to regard what I have said very
lightly, Miss Rosselli," said the unknown voice.
"It would be well if you regarded your love for
Ernest Cameron just as lightly."
</p>

<p>
"He has nothing whatever to do with this
matter," I said quickly.  "I am mistress of my
own actions, and I refuse to be influenced by any
threats uttered by a person who fears to reveal his
identity."
</p>

<p>
"As you will," he replied, with an impatient
movement.  "I am unknown to you, it is true,
but I think I have shown an intimate knowledge
of your private affairs."
</p>

<p>
"If, as you assure me, you are acting in my
interests, you may surely tell me the truth regarding
the mystery surrounding poor Reginald's death,"
I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That is unfortunately not within my power,"
he responded.  "I am in possession only of certain
facts, and have risked much in coming here to-night
to give you warning."
</p>

<p>
"But how can my affairs affect anyone?" I
queried.  "What you have told me is, if true,
most extraordinary."
</p>

<p>
"It is true, and it is, as you say, very extraordinary.
Your friend Mr. Thorne died mysteriously.
I only hope, Miss Rosselli, that you will not
share the same fate."
</p>

<p>
I paused and looked at the curious figure before me.
</p>

<p>
"In order to avoid doing so, then, I am to hold
aloof from Mr. Keppel, remain here until May,
and then travel back to London, there to meet
some person unknown?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  But there is still one thing further.
I am charged to offer for your acceptance a small
present, as some small recompense for the trouble
you must be put to by waiting here in the South,
and then journeying to London," and he drew
from beneath his strangely grotesque dress a small
box, some four or five inches square, wrapped in
paper, which he handed to me.
</p>

<p>
I did not take it.  There was something uncanny
about it all.
</p>

<p>
"Do not hesitate, or we may be observed,"
he said.  "Take it quickly.  Do not open it until
you return to your hotel."
</p>

<p>
With these words he thrust it into my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Remember what I have said," he exclaimed,
rising quickly.  "I must be gone, for I see that
suspicion is aroused by those who are watching.
Act with prudence, and the disaster against which
I have warned you will not occur.  Above all, keep
the appointment in London on the 2nd of June."
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because for your own safety it is imperative,"
he responded, and with a low bow he opened the
door of the box.
</p>

<p>
The next instant I was alone with the little
packet the stranger had given me resting in my
hand.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
SHOWS THE BIRD'S TALONS
</h3>

<p>
For some little time after my mysterious companion
had left I sat forward in the box, gazing down at
the wild revelry below, and hoping that one or
other of the party would recognise me.
</p>

<p>
So great a crowd was there, and so many dresses
exactly similar, that to distinguish Ulrica or Gerald,
or indeed any of the others, proved absolutely
impossible.  They might, of course, be in one or other
of the supper-rooms, and I saw from the first that
there was but little chance of finding them.
</p>

<p>
Leaning my elbows on the edge of the box, I
gazed down upon the scene of reckless merriment,
but my thoughts were full of the strange words
uttered by the mysterious masker.  The packet
he had given me I had transferred to my pocket,
though with pardonable curiosity I longed to open
it and see what it contained.
</p>

<p>
The warning he had given me was extremely
disconcerting.  It worried me.  No woman likes
to think that she has unknown enemies ready to
take her life.  Yet that was apparently my
position.
</p>

<p>
That life could be taken swiftly and without
detection, I had plainly seen in the case of poor
Reggie.  When I recollected his terrible fate I
shuddered.  Yet this man had plainly given me
to understand that the same fate awaited me if I
did not adopt the line of conduct which he had
laid down.
</p>

<p>
Whoever he might be, he certainly was acquainted
with all my movements, and knew intimately
my feelings.  There was certainly no likelihood
of my marriage with old Benjamin Keppel.  I
scouted the idea.  Yet he knew quite well that
the millionaire had become attracted by me, and
reposed in me a confidence which he did not extend
to others.  The more I reflected, the more I became
convinced that the stranger's fear of being recognised
arose from the fact that he himself was either
the murderer or an accessory to the murder of poor
Reggie.
</p>

<p>
What did the demand that I should return to
London denote?  It could only mean one
thing&mdash;namely, that my assistance was required.
</p>

<p>
Whoever were my enemies, they were, I argued,
enemies likewise of old Mr. Keppel.  The present
which the stranger had pressed upon me was
nothing less than a bribe to secure either my
silence or my services.
</p>

<p>
However much I tried, it appeared out of the
question for me to discover the motive guiding
the stranger's conduct.  The only certain fact
was that this man, so cleverly disguised that I
could not distinguish his real height, much less
his form or features, had come there, watched
for a favourable opportunity to speak with me,
and had warned me to sever my friendship with
the millionaire.
</p>

<p>
Leaning there, gazing blankly down upon the
crowd screaming with laughter at the Parisian
quadrilles and antics of clown and columbine, I
coolly analysed my own feeling towards the blunt,
plain-spoken old gentleman with the melancholy
eyes.  I found&mdash;as I had believed all along&mdash;that
I admired him for his honest good-nature, his
utter lack of anything approaching "side," his
strenuous efforts to assist in good works, and his
regard for appearances only for his son's sake.
But I did not love him.  No, I had loved one man.
I could never love another&mdash;never in all my life!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Ernest Cameron was present, disguised
by a mask and dress of parti-coloured satin!
Perhaps he was down there among the dancers,
escorting that woman who had usurped my place.
The thought held me in wonder.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, however, I was brought back to a
due sense of my surroundings by the opening of
the door of the box, and the entry of one of the
theatre attendants, who, addressing me in French,
said:
</p>

<p>
"I beg mademoiselle's pardon, but the Director
would esteem it a favour if mademoiselle would
step down to the bureau at once."
</p>

<p>
"What do they want with me?" I inquired
quickly, with considerable surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Of that I have no knowledge, mademoiselle;
I was merely told to ask you to go there without
delay."
</p>

<p>
Therefore, in wonder, I rose and followed the
man downstairs and through the crowd of revellers
to the private office of the Director, close to the
main entrance of the Casino.
</p>

<p>
In the room I found the Director, an elderly
man, with short, stiff grey hair, sitting at a table,
while near him stood two men dressed as pierrots
with their masks removed.
</p>

<p>
When the door was closed, the Director,
courteously offering me a seat, apologised for
disturbing me, but explained that he had done so at
the request of his two companions.
</p>

<p>
"I may as well at once explain," said the elder
of the two in French, "that we desire some
information which you can furnish."
</p>

<p>
"Of what nature?" I inquired, in a tone of
marked surprise.
</p>

<p>
"In the theatre, an hour ago, you were accosted
by a masker, wearing a dress representing an owl.
You danced with him, but were afterwards lost
in the crowd.  Search was made through all the
rooms for you, but you could not be found.  Where
have you been?"
</p>

<p>
"I have been sitting in the box in conversation
with the stranger."
</p>

<p>
"All the time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He took precautions against being seen."
</p>

<p>
"Who was he?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no idea," I responded, still puzzled by
the man's demand.
</p>

<p>
"I had better, perhaps, explain at once to
mademoiselle that we are agents of police," he said,
with a smile, "and that the movements of the
individual who met you and chatted with you so
affably are of the greatest interest to us."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know who he is?" I exclaimed quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We have discovered that."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, it is not our habit to give
details of any case on which we are engaged until
it is completed."
</p>

<p>
"The case in question is the murder of
Mr. Thorne at the 'Grand Hotel,' is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle guesses correctly.  She was a
friend of the unfortunate gentleman's, if I mistake
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, in a confidential tone, while
his companion, a slightly younger man, stood by
regarding me and tugging at his moustache, "we
should esteem it a favour if you would kindly
relate all that has transpired this evening.  When
we saw him meet you we were not certain of his
identity.  His disguise was puzzling.  Afterwards
there could be no doubt, but he had then disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"I had thought that the police had relinquished
their inquiries," I said, gratified, nevertheless, to
know that they were still on the alert.
</p>

<p>
"It is when we relax our efforts slightly that
we have the better chance of success," the detective
replied.  "Did the man give you any name?"
</p>

<p>
"No; he refused to tell me who he was."
</p>

<p>
"And what was his excuse for accosting you
and demanding a <i>tête-à-tête</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he wished to warn me of an impending
peril.  In brief, he told me that my life was in
jeopardy."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" the man ejaculated, as he exchanged a
meaning glance with his companion.  "And his
pretence was to give you warning of it.  Did he
tell you by whom your life was threatened?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He refused any details, but made certain
suggestions as to the course I should pursue."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds interesting.  What did he suggest?"
</p>

<p>
I hesitated for a few moments.  Then reflecting
that the stranger was evidently under the observation
of the police, and that the latter were trying
to bring poor Reggie's assassin to justice, I
resolved to reveal all that had passed between us.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I gave a brief outline of our conversation
just as I have written it in the foregoing pages.
Both detectives, at hearing my story, seemed very
much puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"You will pardon my intrusion," exclaimed the
agent of police who had first spoken to me, "but
as you will see, this is a clue which must be
thoroughly investigated.  Will mademoiselle
forgive me for asking whether there is any truth in
this man's surmise that she is about to become
engaged to marry this Monsieur Keppel?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever," I answered frankly.  "I
can only suppose that some unfounded gossip has
arisen, as it so often does, and that it has reached
his ears."
</p>

<p>
"Yet he threatens&mdash;or at least warns you of
peril if you should become the wife of this wealthy
monsieur!  Ah! there seems to be some very
deep motive; what it really is, we must seek to
discover.  When we have found it we shall have, I
feel confident, a clue to the murderer of Monsieur
Thorne."
</p>

<p>
"But there is still another rather curious fact,"
I went on, now determined to conceal nothing.
"He declared that it was necessary for my
well-being that I should return to London, and there
meet some person who would visit me on the 2nd
of June next."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  And you intend keeping that appointment,
I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"I intend to do nothing of the kind, monsieur,"
I replied, with a laugh.  "The affair is a very ugly
one, and I have no desire whatever that my name
should be linked further with it."
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  I quite understand the annoyance
caused to mademoiselle.  It is sufficient to have
one's friend murdered in that mysterious manner,
without being pestered by mysterious individuals
who mask themselves and prophesy all sorts of
unpleasant things if their orders are not obeyed.
Did you promise to return to London?"
</p>

<p>
"I said I would consider the advisability of
doing so."
</p>

<p>
"You are diplomatic&mdash;eh?" he said, with a
laugh.  "It is unfortunate that this fellow has
slipped through our fingers so cleverly&mdash;very
unfortunate!"
</p>

<p>
"But if he is known to you, there will surely
not be much difficulty in rediscovering him."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's just the question, you see.  We
are not absolutely certain as to his identity."  Then
after a slight pause, he glanced at me and asked
suddenly: "Mademoiselle has a friend&mdash;or had a
friend&mdash;named Cameron&mdash;a Monsieur Ernest
Cameron?  Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
I think I must have blushed beneath the piece of
black velvet which hid my cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"That is correct," I stammered.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"The reason is unimportant," he answered
carelessly.  "The fact is written in the papers
concerning the case, and we like always to verify
facts in such a case as this&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"But he has no connection with this tragic
business!" I hastened to declare.  "I haven't
spoken to him for nearly two years&mdash;we have been
apart for quite that time."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said the man reassuringly; "the
fact has nothing to do with the matter.  I merely
referred to it in order to obtain confirmation of our
reports.  You mentioned something of a proposed
yachting cruise.  What did this mysterious
individual say regarding that?"
</p>

<p>
"He warned me not to go on board the
<i>Vispera</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Vispera</i>?" he interrupted.  "The owner
of the yacht is monsieur the millionaire, is he
not?"
</p>

<p>
I responded in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"And this Monsieur Keppel has invited you to
go with others on a cruise to Naples?
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But how did you know that it was to
Naples?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"All yachts sailing from Nice eastward go to
Naples," he answered, laughing.  "I suppose the
programme includes a run to the Greek islands.
Constantinople, Smyrna, and Tunis, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so; but I have not yet heard definitely."
</p>

<p>
"You have accepted the invitation, I take it?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And that, of course, lends colour to the belief
that monsieur the millionaire is in love with you,
for it is well known that although he has that
magnificent yacht he never goes on a pleasure
cruise."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help what may be thought by gossips,"
I said hastily.  "Mr. Keppel is a friend of
mine&mdash;nothing further."
</p>

<p>
"But this friendship has apparently caused
certain apprehensions to arise in the minds of the
persons of whom your mysterious companion was
the mouthpiece&mdash;the people who threaten you with
death should you disobey them."
</p>

<p>
"Who are those people, do you imagine?" I
inquired, deeply in earnest, for the matter seemed
to grow increasingly serious.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders.  "If we knew that we should have no
difficulty in arresting the assassin of Monsieur
Thorne."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you consider my best course?"
I asked, utterly bewildered by the mysterious events
of the evening.
</p>

<p>
"I should advise you to keep your own counsel,
and leave the inquiries to us," was the detective's
rejoinder.  "If this man again approaches you,
make an appointment with him later and acquaint
us with the time and place at once."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't anticipate that I shall see him
again."
</p>

<p>
Then, determined to render these police agents
every assistance, even though they had been
stupidly blind to allow the stranger to escape, I
drew from my pocket the small packet which he
had given me.
</p>

<p>
"This," I said, "he handed to me at the last
instant, accompanied by a hope that I would not
fail to keep the appointment in London."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Will you permit us to open it?" he inquired,
much interested.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I responded.  "I am anxious to
see what it contains."
</p>

<p>
The detective took it, and cut the string with
his pocket-knife; then, while his subordinate and
the Director of the Casino craned their necks to
investigate, he unwrapped paper after paper until
he came to a square jewel-case covered in dark
crimson leather.
</p>

<p>
"An ornament, I suppose!" exclaimed the detective.
</p>

<p>
Then he opened the box, and from its velvet-lined
depths something fell to the ground which
caused us to utter a loud cry of surprise in chorus.
</p>

<p>
The detective stooped to pick it up.
</p>

<p>
I stood dumbfounded and aghast.  In his hand
was a bundle of folded French bank-notes&mdash;each
for one thousand francs.  They were the notes
stolen from Reginald Thorne by his assassin.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
MAKES ONE POINT PLAIN
</h3>

<p>
"Extraordinary!" ejaculated the detective,
whose habitual coolness seemed utterly upset by
the unexpected discovery.  "This adds an entirely
new feature to the case!"
</p>

<p>
"What, I wonder, could have been the motive in
giving the notes to mademoiselle?" queried his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"How can we tell?" said the other.  "It at
least proves one thing, namely, that the man in the
owl's dress is the person we suspected him to be."
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe him to be the actual assassin?"
I gasped.
</p>

<p>
But the detectives, with the aid of the Director
of the Theatre, were busy counting the stolen notes.
There were sixty, each for one thousand francs.
</p>

<p>
They examined the leather jewellery case, but
found no mark upon it, nor upon the paper
wrappings.  The box was such as might have once
contained a bracelet, but the raised velvet-covered
spring in the interior had been removed in order
to admit of the introduction of the notes, which,
even when folded, formed a rather large packet.
</p>

<p>
"They are undoubtedly those stolen from
Monsieur Thorne," the detective said.  "In these
circumstances, it is our duty to take possession
of them as evidence against the criminal.  I shall
lodge them with the Prefect of Police until we
have completed the inquiry."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I answered.  "I have no desire
to keep them in my possession.  The history
connected with them is far too gruesome.  But
whatever motive could there be in handing them over
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that we hope to discover later," the
detective responded, carefully folding them,
replacing them in the case, and taking charge of the
wrappings, which it was believed might form some
clue.  "At present it would seem very much as
though the assassin handed you the proceeds of
the crime in order to convince you that robbery
was not the motive."
</p>

<p>
"Then you do believe that the man in the owl's
dress was the real culprit?" I cried eagerly.  "If
so, I have actually danced to-night with poor
Reggie's murderer!" I gasped.
</p>

<p>
"It is more than likely that we shall be able to
establish that fact," the subordinate observed,
in a rather uncertain tone.
</p>

<p>
"How unfortunate," ejaculated his superior,
"that we allowed him to slip through our fingers
thus&mdash;and with the money actually upon him, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," observed the Director of the Casino.
"You have certainly to-night lost an excellent
opportunity, messieurs.  It is curious that neither
of you noticed mademoiselle in the box talking
with this mysterious individual."
</p>

<p>
"That was, I think, impossible," I remarked.
"We sat quite back in the small alcove."
</p>

<p>
"What number was your box?" the Director asked.
</p>

<p>
"Fifteen."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, of course!" he said quickly.  "There is,
I remember, a kind of alcove at the back.  You sat
in there."
</p>

<p>
"Well," observed the chief detective, "no good
can be done by remaining here any longer, I
suppose, so we had better endeavour to trace this
interesting person by other means.  The fact that
he has given up the proceeds of the crime is
sufficient to show that he means to leave Nice.
Therefore we must lose no time," and he glanced at his
watch.  "Ten minutes to two," he said.  Then
turning to his assistant, he ordered him to drive
to the station to see whether the man who had
worn the disguise of the night-bird was among
the travellers leaving for Marseilles at 2.30.
"Remain on duty at the station until I send and
relieve you," he said.  "There are several special
trains to Cannes and to Monte Carlo about three
o'clock, on account of the ball.  Be careful to watch
them all.  It's my opinion he may be going to
cross the frontier at Ventimiglia.  I'll telephone
there as soon as I get down to the bureau."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bien, monsieur!</i>" answered the other.
</p>

<p>
As they went out, after wishing me good-night,
I followed them, asking of the senior of the
pair:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, monsieur, what is my best course of
action?  Do you think the threats are serious?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," he said reassuringly.  "My dear
mademoiselle, don't distress yourself in the very
least regarding what this man has said.  He has
only endeavoured to frighten you into rendering
him assistance.  Act just as you think proper.
Your experience to-night has certainly been a
strange one; but if I were in your place, I would
return to the hotel, sleep soundly, and forget it
all until&mdash;well, until we make our arrest."
</p>

<p>
"You expect to do so, then?"
</p>

<p>
"We, of course, hope so.  In my profession,
you know, everything is uncertain.  So much
depends upon chance," and he smiled pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I presume you will communicate with me
later as to the further result of your
investigations?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly.  Mademoiselle shall be kept
well informed of our operations, never fear."
</p>

<p>
We were at the door of the Casino, where a great
crowd had assembled to watch the maskers emerging.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I call you a fiacre?" he asked quite
gallantly.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," I responded.  "I'll walk.
It is only a few steps to the 'Grand.'"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, of course," he laughed.  "I had forgotten.
<i>Bon soir</i>, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
I wished him good-night, and the next moment he
was lost in the crowd, while, with my mind full
of my extraordinary adventure, I walked along the
Quai St. Jean Baptiste to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
The incidents had been so strange that they seemed
beyond belief.
</p>

<p>
I found the faithful Felicita dozing, but Ulrica had
not returned.  When she entered, however, a
quarter of an hour later, she was in the highest
of spirits, declaring that she had experienced a
most delightful time.
</p>

<p>
"My opinion of the Carnival ball, my dear, is
that it's by far the jolliest function on the Riviera,"
she declared.  Then in the same breath she proceeded
to give me an outline of her movements from
the time we were lost to one another in the crowd.
She had, it appeared, had supper with Gerald
and several friends, and the fun had been fast and
furious.  Her dress was badly torn in places, and
certainly her dishevelled appearance showed that
she had entered very thoroughly into the boisterous
amusement of Carnival.
</p>

<p>
"And you?" she inquired presently.  "What
in the world became of you?  We searched
everywhere before supper, but couldn't find you."
</p>

<p>
"I met a rather entertaining partner," I
responded briefly.
</p>

<p>
"A stranger?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," and I gave her a look by which she
understood that I intended to say nothing before
Felicita.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the subject dropped, and as I had
promised to tell her of my strange adventure later,
she left me for the night.
</p>

<p>
I am seldom troubled by insomnia, but that
night little sleep came to my eyes.  Lying awake
has no attraction for anyone; yet it is an experience
which many have to suffer constantly, though not
gladly.  That night my brain was troubled by a
thousand conflicting thoughts.  I turned on to
the side on which I usually sleep, and closed my
eyes.  But immediately ideas and suggestions of all
kinds rushed at me.  It was then that I recalled
the mistakes of that night.  I noted the opportunities
missed, thought of the right things that I
had left unsaid, and groaned at the thought of
what really found utterance.  Round and round
went my mental machinery, and I knew well that
sleep was not to be expected.
</p>

<p>
A terrible restlessness set in upon me, and turn
succeeded turn, till I wished myself a polygon, so
that the sides to which I could change might be
more numerous.  Some people have recourse to
a small shelf of bedside books to lull them to rest.
I think it was Thackeray who said, "'Montaigne'
and 'Howell's Letters' are my bedside books.  If
I wake at night I have one or other of them to
prattle me off to sleep again."  Montaigne seems
to have been a favourite author with many people
for this purpose.  The cheerful, companionable
garrulity of the Gascon is the ideal pabulum for
those suffering from wakeful hours at night, for
both Pope and Wycherley used to lull themselves
to sleep by his aid.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I had no Montaigne&mdash;nothing, indeed,
more literary or prattling than a couple of the
local newspapers of Nice.  Therefore I was
compelled to lie and endure the thoughts which fled
through my brain in a noisy whirr, and prevented
me falling off into slumber.  The hotel seemed full
of noise.  Strange sounds came from the staircase,
and stealthy footfalls seemed to make themselves
audible.  From the outer world came other sounds,
some familiar, others inexplicable&mdash;all jarring upon
the delicate nerves of hearing.
</p>

<p>
I lay there thinking it all over.  I had now not
the slightest doubt that the man in the owl's dress
was the actual assassin of poor Reggie.  And I
had chatted amiably with him.  I had actually
danced with him!  The very thought held me
horrified.
</p>

<p>
What marvellous self-confidence the fellow had
displayed; what cool audacity, what unwarrantable
interference in my private affairs, and what a
terrible counter-stroke he had effected in presenting
me with the actual notes filched from the dead
man's pocket!  The incident was rendered the
more bewildering on account of the entire absence
of motive.  I lay awake reflecting upon it the whole
night long.
</p>

<p>
When we took our morning coffee together I
related to Ulrica all that had passed.  She sat,
a pretty and dainty figure in her lace-trimmed
and beribboned <i>robe de chambre</i>, leaning her bare
elbows upon the table, and listening open-mouthed.
</p>

<p>
"And the police actually allowed him to escape
scot-free?" she cried indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"The thing is monstrous.  I begin to think
that their failure to trace the murderer is because
they are in league with him.  Here abroad, one
never knows."
</p>

<p>
"No, I think not," I responded.  "He was
clever enough to evade observation, and took care
to make the most of the little alcove in the box."
</p>

<p>
"But the stolen notes!" she cried.  "He evidently
wished to get rid of them in order to avoid
being found with the money in his possession.  So he
presented you with them.  A grim present,
certainly.  The fellow apparently has a sense of
humour."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, my dear Ulrica, I'm terribly upset.
I haven't slept at all."
</p>

<p>
"Enough to upset anyone," she declared.  "We
must tell Gerald, and ask his advice."
</p>

<p>
"No, we must not tell him all.  I beg of you to
say nothing regarding myself and old Mr. Keppel."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  I shall be discreet, rely upon
me.  Gerald will advise us how to act."
</p>

<p>
"Or the old gentleman might give us some
advice," I suggested; for Gerald was given to fits
of frivolity, and this was a matter extremely serious.
</p>

<p>
"You intend to say nothing of the appointment in
London?" she inquired, looking at me sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I responded.  "That is a secret
between us."
</p>

<p>
"Do you intend to keep it?"
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely know.  My actions will, of course, be
controlled by the discoveries of the police."
</p>

<p>
"The police!" she ejaculated.  "I don't believe
in them at all.  They make a great pretence, but
do nothing."
</p>

<p>
"They evidently know the individual who came
to me last night."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  But why didn't they arrest him
when he was under their very noses.  No, my
dear Carmela, depend upon it, here, in this world of
Monte Carlo, the police are bribed, just as the Press,
the railwaymen, and postmen are bribed, by these
rulers of the Riviera, the Administration of the
Société des Bains de Mer de Monaco."
</p>

<p>
"That may be so," I observed wonderingly.
"But the fact still remains that last night I danced
with Reggie's assassin."
</p>

<p>
"Did he dance well?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ulrica!  Don't treat the thing humorously!"
I protested.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not humorous.  The worst of Carnival balls
is that they're such mixed affairs.  One meets
millionaires and murderers, and rubs shoulders
with the most notorious women in Europe.  Your
adventure, however, is absolutely unique.  If it
got into the papers, what a nice little story it would
make, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake no!" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you don't want it to reach the <i>Petit
Niçois</i> or the <i>Eclaireur</i>, you'd better be pretty close
about it.  Poor Reggie's murder is a mystery and
the public fondly delight to read anything about
a mystery."
</p>

<p>
"But we can trust Gerald and Mr. Keppel,"
I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she answered.  "But what a
strange thing it is that this man, whoever he is,
noticed exactly what I also had noticed, namely,
that the old gentleman is among your admirers."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It almost seems as though he were
actually in our circle of friends, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Carmela," she said, "the affair of
poor Reggie's death was curious enough, but its
motive is absolutely inscrutable.  This man who met
you last night was, as the police properly described
him, a veritable artist.  He disguised himself as
an owl because the dress of a bird would conceal
his real height or any personal deformity, while
the face was, of course, entirely hidden by the
beaked mask.  Had he gone as a pierrot, or in
the more ordinary guises, he might have betrayed
himself."
</p>

<p>
"But the return of the stolen money," I
observed.  "Can you imagine why he ran such a
risk?  He condemned himself."
</p>

<p>
"No, I really can't.  It is an absolute enigma."
</p>

<p>
We discussed it for a long time, until the entrance
of Felicita caused us to drop the subject.  Yes, it
was, as Ulrica had declared, an absolute enigma.
</p>

<p>
About four o'clock in the afternoon, when we
had both dressed ready to go out&mdash;for we had
accepted an invitation to go on an excursion in
an automobile up to Tourette&mdash;the waiter entered
with a card, which Ulrica took and read.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she sighed.  "Here's another detective.
Don't let him keep us, dear.  You know the Allens
won't wait for us.  They said four o'clock sharp,
opposite Vogarde's."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't refuse to see him," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," she replied, and turning to the
waiter, ordered him to show the caller up.
</p>

<p>
"There are two gentlemen," he explained.
</p>

<p>
"Then show them both up," answered Ulrica.
"Be sharp, please, as we are in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame," responded the waiter, a young
Swiss, and went below.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they are the pair I saw last night,"
I said.  "The police on the Continent seem always
to hunt in couples.  One never sees a single
gendarme, either in France or in Italy."
</p>

<p>
"One goes to keep the other cheerful, I believe,"
Ulrica remarked.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later the two callers were shown in.
</p>

<p>
They were not the same as I had seen in the
Director's room at the Casino.
</p>

<p>
"I regret this intrusion," said the elder, a
dark-bearded, rather unwholesome-looking individual
with lank black hair.  "I have, I believe, the
honour of addressing Mademoiselle Rosselli."
</p>

<p>
"That is my name," I responded briefly, for
I did not intend them to cause me to lose a most
enjoyable trip in that most <i>chic</i> of latter-day
conveyances, an automobile.
</p>

<p>
"We are police agents, as you have possibly seen
from my card, and have called merely to ask whether
you can identify either of these photographs."  And
he took two cabinet pictures from his pocket
and handed them to me.
</p>

<p>
One was a prison photograph of an elderly, sad-eyed
convict, with a rather bald head and a scraggy
beard, while the other was a well-taken likeness of
a foppishly-dressed young man of about twenty-eight,
the upward trend of his moustache denoting
him to be a foreigner.
</p>

<p>
Both were strangers to me.  I had never seen
either of them in the flesh, at least to my
knowledge, and Ulrica was also agreed that she had
never seen anyone bearing the slightest resemblance
to either.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle is absolutely certain?" the
detective asked of me.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," I responded.
</p>

<p>
"Will mademoiselle have the kindness to allow
her memory to go back for one moment to the day
of the unfortunate gentleman's death?" asked the
detective, with an amiable air.  "At the time
Monsieur Thorne was at the table at Monte Carlo
and playing with success, there were, I believe,
many persons around him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a crowd."
</p>

<p>
"And near him, almost at his elbow, you did
not see this man?" he inquired, indicating the
bearded convict.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"I really do not recollect the face of any member
of that excited crowd," I responded.  "He may
have been there, but I certainly did not see him."
</p>

<p>
"Nor did I," chimed in Ulrica.
</p>

<p>
"Then I much regret troubling you," he said,
bowing politely.  "In this affair we are, as you of
course know, making very searching inquiries on
account of representations made by the British
Ambassador in Paris.  We intend, if possible, to
solve the mystery."
</p>

<p>
"And the man who accosted me at the ball
last night," I said.  "Do you suspect him to be
the original of that photograph?"
</p>

<p>
"At the ball last night?  I do not follow
mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"But I made a statement of the whole facts
to two agents of your department at an early hour
this morning&mdash;before I left the Casino."
</p>

<p>
He looked puzzled, and his dark face broadened
into a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon!  But I think mademoiselle must be
under some misapprehension.  What occurred at
the ball?  Anything to arouse your suspicion?"
</p>

<p>
"To arouse my suspicion?" I echoed.  "Why,
a man attired in the garb of an owl accosted me,
gave me a strange warning, and actually placed
in my hands the sixty thousand francs in notes
stolen from the dead man!"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" gasped the detective, amazed.
"Where are the notes?  You should have given
us information instantly."
</p>

<p>
"I handed the notes to two police agents who
were in waiting in the Director's room, and to
whom I made a statement of the whole affair."
</p>

<p>
"What!" he cried loudly.  "You have parted
with the money?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Then mademoiselle has been most cleverly
tricked, for the men to whom you handed the
proceeds of the robbery were certainly not agents
of police!  They were impostors!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
DESCRIBES A MEETING AND ITS SEQUEL
</h3>

<p>
His words staggered me.
</p>

<p>
"Not agents of police!" I cried, dumbfounded.
"Why, they were fully cognisant of every detail
of the affair.  It was the Director of the Casino
who presented them."
</p>

<p>
"Then Monsieur le Directeur was tricked, just
as you were," he answered gravely.  "You say you
actually received from the hand of someone who
wore an effective disguise the sum stolen from the
unfortunate monsieur?  Kindly explain the whole
circumstances of your meeting, and what passed
between you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Carmela," exclaimed Ulrica, "this
fresh complication is absolutely bewildering!  You
not only danced and chatted with the murderer,
but you were the victim of a very clever plot."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite certain," observed the officer.
"The two individuals to whom mademoiselle
innocently gave the notes upon representation
that they were agents of police were evidently well
acquainted with the murderer's intention to give
up the proceeds of the robbery, and had watched
you narrowly all through the evening.  But kindly
give us exact details."
</p>

<p>
In obedience to his demand, I recounted the
whole story.  It seemed to me incredible that the
two men who had sent for me were bogus detectives,
yet such was the actual fact, as was shown later
when the Director of the Casino explained how they
had come to him, telling him that they were police
agents from Marseilles, and had ordered him to
send for me, as they wished to interrogate me
regarding the affair of the "Grand Hotel."  Such,
he declared, was their air of authority that he never
for a moment doubted that they were genuine
officers of police.
</p>

<p>
My statement held the two men absolutely
speechless.  I told them of the strange
appointment in London made by the man with the owl's
face, of the curious warning he had given me, and
of the manner in which he had presented me with
the sum won at the tables by the murdered man.
</p>

<p>
"You can give us absolutely no idea whatever
of his personal appearance?" he inquired dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"None whatever," I answered.  "The dress
and mask were effectual in disguising him."
</p>

<p>
"And the two men who falsely posed as police
agents?  Will you kindly describe them?" And
at the same time he took out a well-worn
pocket-book and scribbled in it.
</p>

<p>
I described their personal appearance as closely
as I could, while on his part he took down my
statement very carefully.
</p>

<p>
"This is most extraordinary!" Ulrica observed,
standing near me in wonder.  "The pair who said
they were detectives were exceedingly clever, and
are evidently aware of all that has occurred."
</p>

<p>
"Marvellous!" exclaimed the man reflectively.
"Only very clever thieves would dare to walk into
the bureau of the Casino and act as they did."
</p>

<p>
"Have they any connection with the actual
assassin, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to believe so," he responded.  "It
was a conspiracy on their part to obtain possession
of the money."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I gave it up in entire innocence,"
I said.  "I never dreamt that such a plot could
exist."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, mademoiselle!" observed the detective,
"in this affair we have evidently to deal with those
who have brought crime to a fine art.  There
seems something remarkable regarding the
appointment in London on the 2nd of June.  It seems
as though it were desired to gain time with some
secret object or another."
</p>

<p>
"I am absolutely bewildered," I admitted.
"My position in this tragic affair is anything but
enviable."
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly, all this must be most annoying
and distressing to mademoiselle.  I only hope we
shall be successful in tracing the real perpetrators
of the crime."
</p>

<p>
"You think there were more than one?"
</p>

<p>
"That is most probable," he replied.  "At
present, however, we still remain without any
tangible clue, save that the proceeds of the crime
have passed from one person to another, through
the agency of yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Their audacity was beyond comprehension!"
I cried.  "It really seems inconceivable that I
should have danced with the actual murderer,
and afterwards been induced to hand over to a
pair of impostors the money stolen from the
unfortunate young man.  I feel that I am to blame
for my shortsightedness."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, mademoiselle, not at all," declared
the detective, with his suave Gallic politeness.
"With such a set of ingenious malefactors, it is
very easy to commit an error, and fall a victim to
roguery."
</p>

<p>
"And what can be done?"
</p>

<p>
"We can only continue our investigations."
</p>

<p>
"But the man in the owl's dress?  Tell me
candidly, do you really believe that he was the
actual murderer?"
</p>

<p>
"He may have been.  It is evident that, for
some hidden purpose, he had an important reason
for passing the stolen notes into your possession."
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is one of the mysteries which we must
try to solve.  The man was French, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"He spoke English admirably."
</p>

<p>
"No word of French?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a single word.  Yet he possessed an
accent rather unusual."
</p>

<p>
"He might have been a foreigner&mdash;an Italian
or German, for aught you know?" the detective
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered reflectively.  "His gestures
were French.  I believe that he was actually
French."
</p>

<p>
"And the bogus police agents?"
</p>

<p>
"They, too, were French, undoubtedly.  It
would have been impossible to deceive the Director
of the Casino, himself a Frenchman."
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle is quite right.  I will at once
see Monsieur le Directeur and hear his statement.
It is best," he added, "that the matter should
remain a profound secret.  Do not mention it,
either of you, even to your nearest friends.
Publicity might very probably render futile all our
inquiries."
</p>

<p>
"I understand," I said.
</p>

<p>
"And mademoiselle will say no word to anyone
about it?"
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Ulrica inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," she answered.  "If monsieur so
wishes, the affair shall be kept secret."
</p>

<p>
Then, after some further discussion, the police
officer thanked us, gave us an assurance of his
most profound respect, and, accompanied by his
silent subordinate, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"After all," I remarked, when they had gone,
"it will be best, perhaps, to say nothing whatever
to Gerald.  He might mention it incautiously
and thus it might get into the papers."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear," answered Ulrica.  "Perhaps
silence is best.  But the trick played upon you
surpasses comprehension.  I don't like the aspect
of affairs at all.  If it were not for the fact that we
have so many friends here, and that it is just the
height of the season, I should suggest the packing
of our trunks."
</p>

<p>
"We shall leave soon," I said; "as soon as
the yachting party is complete."
</p>

<p>
"Gerald told me last night that the old gentleman
has ordered great preparations to be made
for us on board the <i>Vispera</i>.  He intends to do
the thing well, as he always does when he entertains."
</p>

<p>
"We shall, no doubt, have a most glorious time,"
I answered, as together we went forth to meet
the Allens, whom we found with their automobile
brake outside Vogarde's, that smart confectioner's,
where, as you, my reader, know, the cosmopolitan
world of Nice sips tea at four o'clock.  At most
Continental health resorts afternoon tea is
unknown, but with visitors to Nice it is quite a solemn
function, even though they be Parisians, and
never taste tea except in winter on the Côte d'Azur.
At Rumpelmayer's, that white and gold tea-shop,
where many a royal highness or grand duchess
descends to sip a cup and nibble an appetising
piece of confectionery; at the English tea-house
on the Quai Massena, known familiarly to winter
visitors as "the muffin shop," and at Vogarde's,
famed for crystallised fruits, it is usual to meet
everyone who is anyone, and gossip pleasantly
over the tea-cups.  On the Promenade des Anglais
there is no really fashionable hour, as in other
resorts, but the recently-instituted "five o'clock"
is the reunion of everyone, and the chatter is always
polyglot.
</p>

<p>
Our trip to Tourette proved a charming one.
It is a delightful sensation to rush along the road
at the speed of a railway train in an easy vehicle
which trumpets like an elephant at every corner
and passes everything like a flash.  The French
have certainly improved on the ordinary means
of locomotion, and if the automobile is noisy, the
vibration is never felt in travelling, while the
nauseous fumes&mdash;which, it must be admitted, sometimes
half poison the passer-by&mdash;are always behind.
</p>

<p>
That same night, after dinner, we accompanied
the Allens, a middle-aged American, and his wife,
who lived in Paris, over to Monte Carlo.  The
Battle of Flowers had taken place there during
the day, and that event always marks the zenith
of the gaming season.  The Rooms were crowded,
and the dresses, always magnificent at night, were
more daring than ever.  Half fashionable Europe
seemed there, including an English royal highness
and a crowd of other notables.  One of De Lara's
operas was being played in the Casino theatre,
and as this composer is a great favourite there, a
very large audience was attracted.
</p>

<p>
The display of jewels at the tables was that
night the most dazzling I had ever seen.  Some
women, mostly gay Parisiennes or arrogant
Russians, seemed literally covered with diamonds;
and as they stood round the table risking their
louis or five-franc pieces, it seemed strange that
with jewels of that worth upon them they should
descend to play with such paltry stakes.  But
many women at Monte Carlo play merely because
it is the correct thing so to do, and very often are
careless of either loss or gain.
</p>

<p>
The usual characters were there; the wizened
old man with his capacious purse; the old hag in
black cashmere, with her rouged face, playing and
winning; and alas! the foolish young man who
staked always in the wrong place, until he had
flung away his last louis.  In all the world there
is no stranger panorama of life than that presented
at ten o'clock at night at the tables of Monte Carlo.
It is unique!  It is indescribable!  It is appalling!
</p>

<p>
Temptation is spread there before the unwary
in all its forms, until the fevered atmosphere of
gold and avarice throbs with evil, becomes
nauseous, and one longs for a breath of the fresh
night air and a refreshing drink to take the bad
taste out of one's mouth.
</p>

<p>
I played merely because Ulrica and Dolly Allen
played.  I think I won three or four louis, but am
not certain of the amount.  You ask why?
</p>

<p>
Because there was seated at the table, exactly
opposite where I stood, unnoticed among the
crowd, no less a person than Ernest Cameron.
</p>

<p>
At his side was the inevitable red and black
card whereon he registered each number as it came
up; before him were several little piles of louis
and a few notes, while behind him, leaning now and
then over his chair and whispering, was <i>that
woman</i>!
</p>

<p>
At frequent intervals he played, generally upon
the dozens, and even then rather uncertainly.  But
he often lost.  Once or twice he played with fairly
large stakes upon a chance which appeared practically
certain, but he had no fine fortune, and the
croupier raked in his money.
</p>

<p>
For fully a dozen times he staked two louis on
the last twelve numbers, but with that perversity
which sometimes seems to seize the roulette-ball,
the numbers came up between 1 and 24.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the tow-haired woman who had replaced
myself in his affections leaned over, and
said in a voice quite audible to me:
</p>

<p>
"Put the maximum on number 6!"
</p>

<p>
With blind obedience he counted out the sum
sufficient to win the maximum of six thousand
francs, and pushed it upon the number she had
named.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>" cried the croupier the next
instant, and then, sure enough, I saw the ball
drop into the number the witch had prophesied.
</p>

<p>
The croupier counted the stake quickly, and
pushed with his rake towards the fortunate player
notes for six thousand francs, with the simple words:
</p>

<p>
"<i>En plein!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Enough!" cried the woman, prompting him.
"Play no more to-night."
</p>

<p>
He sighed, and with a strange, preoccupied air
gathered up his coin, notes, and other belongings,
while a player tossed over a five-franc piece to
"mark" his place, or, in other words, to secure his
chair when he vacated it.  Then, still obedient to
her, he rose with a faint smile upon his lips.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, he raised his eyes, and they fell full
upon mine, for I was standing there watching him.
</p>

<p>
Our gaze met, suddenly.  Next instant, however,
the light died out of his countenance, and he stood
glaring at me as though I were an apparition.  His
mouth was slightly opened, his hand trembled, his
brow contracted, and his face grew ashen.
</p>

<p>
His attitude was as though he were cowed by
my presence.  He remembered our last meeting.
</p>

<p>
In a moment, however, he recovered his
self-possession, turned his back upon me, and strolled
away beside the woman who had usurped my place.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
CARRIES ME ON BOARD THE "VISPERA"
</h3>

<p>
Faces, even expressions, may lie, but eyes never
learn the knack of falsehood.  A man may commit
follies; but once cured, those follies expand his
nature.  With a woman, sad to tell, follies are always
debasing.  It was, I knew, a folly to love Ernest
Cameron.
</p>

<p>
Life is always disappointing.  The shattering
of our idols, the revelation of the shallowness of
friendship, the losing faith in those we love, and
the witnessing of their fall from that pedestal
whereon we placed them in our own exalted
idealisation&mdash;all is disappointing.
</p>

<p>
I stood gazing after him as he strode down the
great room with its bejewelled and excited crowd,
in which the <i>chevalier d'industrie</i> and the <i>déclassée</i>
woman jostled against pickpockets and the men
who gamble at Aix, Ostend, Namur or Spa, as the
seasons come and go&mdash;that strange assembly of
courteous Italians, bearded Russians, well-groomed
Englishmen, and women painted, powdered and
perfumed.
</p>

<p>
I held my breath; my heart beat so violently
that I could hear it above the babel of voices about
me.  I suffered the most acute agony.  Of late I
had been always thinking of him&mdash;asleep,
dreaming&mdash;always dreaming of him.  Always the same pang
of regret was within my heart&mdash;regret that I had
allowed him to go away without a word, without
telling him how madly, how despairingly I loved him.
</p>

<p>
Life without him was a hopeless blank, yet it was
all through my vanity, my wretched pride, my
invincible self-love.  I was now careless, indifferent,
inconsequential, my only thought being of him.
His coldness, his disdain was killing me.  When
his eyes had met mine in surprise, they were strange,
Sphinx-like, and mysterious.
</p>

<p>
Yet at that moment I did not care what he might
say to me.  I only wished to hear him speaking
to me; to hear the sound of his voice, and to know
that he cared enough for me to treat me as a human
being.
</p>

<p>
Ah!  I trembled when I realised how madly I
loved him, and how fierce was my hatred of that
woman who issued her orders and whom he obeyed.
</p>

<p>
I turned away with the Allens, and Ulrica cried
delightedly that she had won on 16, her favourite
number.  But I did not answer.  My heart had
grown sick, and I went forth into the healing night
air and down the steps towards the <i>ascenseurs</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the steps a well-dressed young Frenchman
was lounging, and as I passed down I heard him
humming to himself that catchy <i>chanson</i> so popular
at the café-concert:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>A bas la romance et l'idylle,<br>
  Lea oiseaux, la forêt, le buisson<br>
  Des marlous, de la grande ville,<br>
  Nous allons chanter la chanson!<br>
  V'la les dos, viv'nt les dos!<br>
  C'est les dos les gros,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Les beaux,<br>
  A nous les marmites!<br>
  Grandes ou petites;<br>
  V'la les dos, viv'nt les dos;<br>
  C'est les dos les gros,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Les beaux,<br>
  A nous les marmit' et vivent les los!"</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I closed my ears to shut out the sound of those
words.  I remembered Ernest&mdash;that look in his
eyes, that scorn in his face, that disdain in his
bearing.
</p>

<p>
The truth was only too plain.  His love for me
was dead.  I was the most wretched of women, of
all God's creatures.
</p>

<p>
I prayed that I might regard him&mdash;that I might
regard the world&mdash;with indifference.  And yet I
was sufficiently acquainted with the world and
its ways to know that to a woman the word indifference
is the most evil word in the language; that it
bears upon the most fatal of all sentiments; that
it brings about the most deadly of all mental attitudes.
</p>

<p>
But Ernest, the man whose slave I was, despised
me.  He commanded my love; why could not I
command his?  Ah, because I was a woman&mdash;and
my face had ceased to interest him!
</p>

<p>
Bitter tears sprang to my eyes, but I managed to
preserve my self-control and enter the station-lift,
making an inward vow that never again, in my
whole life, would I set foot in that hated hell within
a paradise called Monte Carlo.
</p>

<p>
True, I was a woman who, abandoned by the
man she loved, amused herself wherever amusement
could be procured; but I still remained an honest
woman, as I had always been ever since those sweet
and well-remembered days spent in the grey old
convent outside Florence.  At Monte Carlo the
scum of the earth enjoy the flowers of the earth.  I
detested its crowds; I held in abhorrence that
turbulent avarice, and felt stifled in that atmosphere
of gilded sin.  No!  I would never enter there
again.  The bitter remembrance of that night
would, I knew, be too painful.
</p>

<p>
Thus I returned to Nice with a feeling that for
me, now that Ernest had drifted away from my side
to become a placid gambler, and to live careless of my
love, life had no further charm.  The recollection
of the days that followed can never be torn from
my memory, my brain, my soul.  I smiled, though
I was wearing out my heart; I laughed, even
though bitter tears were ready to start into my
eyes, and I made pretence of being interested in
things to which I was at heart supremely indifferent.
I courted forgetfulness, but the oblivion of my love
would not come.  I never knew till then how great
was the passion a woman could conceive for a man,
or how his memory could continually arise as a
ghost from the past to terrify the present.
</p>

<p>
That night, as we drove from the station to the
hotel, Ulrica accidentally touched my hand.
</p>

<p>
"How cold you are, dear!" she cried in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered, shivering.
</p>

<p>
I was cold; it was the truth.  At thought of
the man who had forsaken me an icy chill had
struck my heart&mdash;the chill of unsatisfied love, of
desolation, of blank, unutterable despair.
</p>

<p>
In due course our yachting gowns came home from
the dressmaker's&mdash;accompanied by terrifying bills,
of course&mdash;and a few days later we sailed out of
Villefranche Harbour on board the <i>Vispera</i>.  The
party was a well-chosen one, consisting mostly of
youngish people, several of whom we knew quite
well, and before the second day was over we had all
settled down to the usual routine of life on board a
yacht.  There was no sensation of being cramped
up, but on the contrary the decks were broad and
spacious, and the cabins perfect nests of luxury.
The vessel had been built on the Clyde in accordance
with its owner's designs, and it certainly was an
Atlantic liner in miniature.
</p>

<p>
Our plans had been slightly altered, for since the
majority of the guests had never been to Algiers, it
was resolved to make a run over there, and then
coast along Algeria and Tunis, and so on to
Alexandria.  As we steamed away from Villefranche, the
receding panorama of the Littoral, with its
olive-covered slopes and great purple snow-capped Alps
spread out before us, presenting a perfectly enchanting
picture.  We all stood grouped on deck watching
it slowly sink below the horizon.  From the first
moment that we went on board, indeed, all was
gay, all luxurious; for were we not guests of a
man who, although absurdly economical himself,
was always lavish when he entertained?  Everyone
was loud in praise of the magnificent appointments
of the vessel; and the dinner at which its owner
presided was a meal sparkling with merriment.
</p>

<p>
I was placed next Lord Eldersfield, a pleasant,
middle-aged, grey-eyed man, who had recently left
the Army on succeeding to the title.  He was, I
found, quite an entertaining companion, full of
droll stories and clever witticisms; indeed, he
shone at once as the chief conversationalist of the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Have I been in Algiers before?" he repeated,
in answer to a question from me.  "Oh, yes.
It's a place where one half the people don't know
the other half."
</p>

<p>
I smiled and wondered.  Yet his brief description
was, I afterwards discovered, very true.  The Arabs
and the Europeans live apart, and are like oil and
water; they never mix.
</p>

<p>
The day passed merrily, and had it not been for
constant thoughts of the man who had loved me
and forgotten, I should have enjoyed myself.
</p>

<p>
Save for one day of mistral, the trip across the
Mediterranean proved delightful; and for six days
we remained in the white old City of the Corsairs,
where we went on excursions, and had a most
pleasant time.  We visited the Kasbah, drove to the
Jardin d'Essai and to the pretty village of
St. Eugène, while several of the party went to visit
friends who were staying at the big hotels up at
Mustapha.
</p>

<p>
Life in Algiers was, I found, most interesting
after the Parisian artificiality and the glitter of
Nice and Monte Carlo; and with Lord Eldersfield
as my cavalier, I saw all that was worth seeing.  We
lounged in those gay French cafés under the
date-palms in the Place du Gouvernement, strolled up
those narrow, ladder-like streets in the old city, and
mingled with those crowds of mysterious-looking
veiled Arab women who were bargaining for their
purchases in the market.  All was fresh; all was
diverting.
</p>

<p>
As for Ulrica, she entered thoroughly into the
spirit of the new sensation, as she always did, and,
with Gerald usually as her escort, went hither and
thither with her true tourist habit of poking about
everywhere, regardless of contagious diseases or
the remarkable variety of bad smells which
invariably exist in an Oriental town.  Although
each day the party went ashore and enjoyed
themselves, old Mr. Keppel never accompanied them.
He knew the place, he said, and he had some business
affairs to attend to in the deck-house, which he
kept secret to himself.  Therefore he was excused.
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss Rosselli," he had explained to me in
confidence, "I'm no sight-seer.  If my guests
enjoy seeing a few of the towns on the Mediterranean
I am quite contented; but I prefer to remain quiet
here, rather than drive about in brakes and revisit
places that I have already visited long ago."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I said.  "You are under no obligation
to these people.  They accept your kind
hospitality, and the least they can do is to allow you
to remain in peace where you wish."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he sighed.  "I leave them in Gerald's
charge.  He knows how to look after them."
</p>

<p>
And his face seemed sad and anxious, as though
he were utterly forlorn.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, after a week at sea we saw but very little
of him.  He lunched and dined with us in the
saloon each day, but never joined our musical
parties after dinner, and seldom, if ever, entered the
smoking-room.  Because all knew him to be eccentric,
this apparent disregard of our presence was
looked upon as one of his peculiar habits.  Upon
Gerald devolved the duty of acting as entertainer,
and, assisted by Ulrica, old Miss Keppel and
myself, he endeavoured to make everyone happy and
comfortable.  Fortunately, the ubiquitous Barnes
had, by Gerald's desire, been left behind at the
Villa Fabron.
</p>

<p>
As day by day we steamed up that tranquil sea
in brilliant weather, with our bows ever thrusting
themselves toward the dawn, life was one continual
round of merriment from three bells, when we
breakfasted, until eight bells sounded for turning
in.  A yachting cruise is very apt to become
monotonous, but on the <i>Vispera</i> one had no time for
<i>ennui</i>.  After Algiers, we put in for a day at
Cagliari, then visited Tunis, the Greek Islands,
Athens, Smyrna, and Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
We had already been a month cruising&mdash;and a
month in the Mediterranean in spring is
delightful&mdash;when one night an incident occurred which was
both mysterious and disconcerting.  We were on
our way from Constantinople, and in the first
dog-watch had sighted one of the rocky headlands of
Corsica.  That evening dinner had been followed
by an impromptu dance, which had proved a most
successful affair.  The men were mostly dancers,
except Lord Stoneborough, who was inclined to
obesity, and what with the piano and a couple of
violins, played by a pair of rather insipid sisters,
the dance was quite a jolly one.  We persuaded
even old Mr. Keppel to dance, and although his
was a not very graceful feat, nevertheless his
participation in our fun put everyone in an exceedingly
good humour.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the month had not passed without the
usual gossip and tittle-tattle inseparable from a
yachting cruise.  On board a yacht people quickly
become inventive, and the most astounding fictions
about one's neighbours are whispered behind fans
and books.  I had heard whispers regarding Ulrica
and Gerald Keppel.  Rumour had it that the old
gentleman had actually given his consent to their
marriage, and as soon as they returned to England
the engagement would be announced.
</p>

<p>
Certain of the guests, with an air of extreme
confidence, took me aside, and questioned me
regarding it; but I merely responded that I knew
nothing, and greatly doubted the accuracy of the
rumour.  More than once that evening I had been
asked whether it were true, and so persistent seemed
the rumour that I took Ulrica into my cabin, and
asked her point-blank.
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" she cried, "have you really taken
leave of your senses?  How absurd!  Of course,
there's nothing whatever between Gerald and
myself.  He is amusing&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"You might do worse than marry him," I laughed.
"Remember, you've known him a long time&mdash;four
years, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Marry him?  Never!  Go and tell these prying
persons, whoever they are, that when I'm engaged
I'll put a paragraph in the papers all in good time."
</p>

<p>
"But don't you think, Ulrica," I suggested&mdash;"don't
you think that if such is the case, Gerald is
rather too much in your society?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help him hanging around me, poor boy,"
she laughed.  "I can't be rude to him."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, but you might possibly give him
a hint."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now, my dear Carmela," she cried impatiently,
"you want to lecture me, eh?  You know
how I hate being lectured.  Let's end the discussion
before we become bad friends."
</p>

<p>
And so, with a light laugh, she rearranged her hair
and left my cabin to return on deck, where dancing
was still proceeding beneath the great electric lights.
Four bells had rung out sharply, showing it to be
two o'clock, before I went down to my cabin,
attended by Felicita.  Very soon, however, I sent her
to bed and lay down to rest myself.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, I could not sleep that night.  The
monotonous whirr and throbbing of the engines
sounded like continual thunder in my ears, and even
the swish of the long waves as they rose and fell at
the port-hole irritated me.  Of late I had developed
insomnia to an alarming extent, but whether it was
due to the noise of the machinery, or to nervousness,
I know not.
</p>

<p>
I turned and turned in my narrow berth, but could
not sleep.  The atmosphere seemed stifling, in spite
of the ventilators; and I dared not open the port-hole,
fearing a sudden douche, for a wind had sprung
up and we were rolling heavily.  The jingle of the
glasses on the toilet-stand, the vibration, the tramping
of the sailors overhead, the roar of the funnels,
all rendered sleep utterly impossible.
</p>

<p>
At last I could stand it no longer.  I rose and
dressed, putting on a big driving-coat.  Then, with
a thick shawl about my head, I went up on deck.
The fresh air might perhaps do me good, I thought.
At any rate, it was a remedy worth trying.
</p>

<p>
The night, so brilliant a couple of hours before, had
become dark and stormy; the wind was so boisterous
that I walked with difficulty; and the fact
that the awnings had been reefed showed that Davis,
the skipper, anticipated a squall.
</p>

<p>
The deck was deserted.  Only on the bridge could
I see, above the strip of sheltering canvas, two
shadowy figures in oilskins, keeping watch.  Save
for those figures, I was utterly alone.  On my way
towards the stern I passed the small deck-house,
which old Mr. Keppel had reserved as his own den.
</p>

<p>
The green silk blinds were always drawn across the
port-holes, and the door always remained locked.
No one ever entered there, although many had been
the speculations regarding the private cabin when
we had first sailed.
</p>

<p>
The millionaire himself had, however, given an
explanation one day at luncheon.
</p>

<p>
"I always reserve, both in my houses and here,
on board the <i>Vispera</i>, one room as my own.  I hope
all of you will excuse me this.  As you know, I have
a good many affairs to attend to, and I hate to have
my papers thrown into disorder."
</p>

<p>
Personally, I suspected him of having a lathe
there, so that he might pursue his hobby of ivory-turning,
but the majority of the guests accepted his
explanation that this deck-house was his study, and
that he did not wish them to pry there.
</p>

<p>
More than once Ulrica had expressed to me wonder
regarding the reason the cabin remained always
closed, and its curtains always drawn.  Every
woman dearly loves a mystery, and, like myself,
Ulrica, when she discovered anything suspicious,
never rested until she had found some theory or
other.
</p>

<p>
She had one day mentioned the fact to Gerald,
who, in my presence, had given what appeared to
me the true explanation.
</p>

<p>
"It's merely one of the guv'nor's eccentricities.
The fact is, that on the outward voyage from
Portsmouth he bought some antique Moorish furniture
and ivory carvings in Tangier, and has stored all his
purchases in there until we return.  I've seen them
myself&mdash;beautiful things.  He says he intends to sell
them at a profit to a dealer in London," whereat we
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Knowing how the old gentleman practised
economy sometimes, I had accepted this as the truth.
</p>

<p>
But as, gripping the rail to prevent myself being
thrown down by the rolling of the ship, I passed
along the side of the deck-house, I was surprised to
see a light within.  The curtains of green silk were
still drawn, but the light could nevertheless be seen
through them, and it occurred to me strange that
anyone should be there at that hour of the night.  I
placed my face close to the screwed-down port-hole,
but the curtain had been so well drawn that it was
impossible to see within.  Then, moving quietly, I
examined the other three round brass-bound windows,
but all were as closely curtained as the first.
</p>

<p>
I fancied I heard voices as I stood there, and I
confess that I attempted to distinguish the words,
but the roar of the funnels and howlings of the wind
drowned every other sound.
</p>

<p>
What if my host caught me prying?  His private
affairs were surely no business of mine.
Remembering this, I was about to turn away, when
suddenly I experienced an extraordinary desire to
peep inside that forbidden chamber.  I walked
round it again, stealthily, for, as luck would have it,
I was in thin slippers.
</p>

<p>
While standing there in hesitation, I noticed that
upon the low roof was a small ventilator which had
been raised to admit air.  What if I could get a peep
down there!  It was an adventurous climb for a
woman hampered by skirts.  But I searched for
means to mount, and found them in a low iron
staple, to which some cords of the rigging were
attached, and a brass rail which afforded rather
insecure foothold.  After some effort, I succeeded in
scrambling to the top, but not before I found myself
rather too much exposed to the eye of the officer on
the bridge.  Fortunately, I was behind him, but if
he had occasion to turn round he would be sure to
discover me.
</p>

<p>
Having risked so much, however, I was determined
to make further endeavour.  I leaned across the
small roof, placed my face close to the open
ventilator, and peered down into the locked cabin.
</p>

<p>
Next second I drew back with a start, holding my
breath.  A loud exclamation of dismay escaped me,
but the sound was swallowed up in the noises of the
boisterous night.  The sight I witnessed below me
in that small deck-house held me as rigid as if I had
been petrified.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
DISCLOSES A MILLIONAIRE'S SECRET
</h3>

<p>
So heavily was the yacht rolling that I was compelled
to hold firmly, lest I should lose my balance
and roll down upon the deck.
</p>

<p>
My foothold was insecure, and the sight which
presented itself as I peered within was so unexpected
and startling, that in the excitement of the moment
I loosened my grip, and narrowly escaped being
pitched down headlong.  From my position I
unfortunately could not obtain a view of the whole
interior, the ventilator being open only a couple of
inches; but what I saw was sufficient to unnerve
any woman.
</p>

<p>
The cabin was lit brilliantly by electricity, but the
walls, instead of being panelled in satinwood, as
were most of the others, were decorated in a manner
more rich and magnificent than in any other part of
the vessel.  They were gilt, with white ornamentation
in curious arabesques, while upon the floor was
a thick Turkey carpet with a white ground and
pattern of turquoise blue.  The effect was bright and
glaring, and at the first moment it occurred to me
that the place was really a lady's boudoir.  There
was another aft, it was true, but this one had
evidently been intended as a lounge for female guests.
As I looked down, old Benjamin Keppel himself
passed into that part of the cabin within the zone
of my vision.  His hat was off, displaying his scanty
grey hair, and as he turned I caught a glimpse of his
face.  His countenance, usually so kind and tranquil,
was distorted by abject fear; his teeth were set, his
cheeks grey and bloodless.  Both anger and alarm
were depicted upon his rugged countenance.  His
appearance was mysterious, to say the least; but it
was another object within that room which held me
in speechless wonderment.
</p>

<p>
Near where he stood, lying in a heap at his feet,
was a dark-haired, handsome woman, in a white silk
robe&mdash;a stranger.
</p>

<p>
The old millionaire, with a sudden movement,
flung himself upon his knees, and touched her face
caressingly.  The next instant he drew back his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" he gasped, in the thick voice of a man
grief-stricken.  "Dead!  And she did not know&mdash;she
did not know!  It is murder!" he gasped, in a
terrified whisper.  "Murder!"
</p>

<p>
The wind howled about me weirdly, tearing at my
clothes as if it desired to hurl me into the raging sea;
while the yacht, steaming on, rose and plunged,
shipping huge seas each time her bows met the angry
waves.
</p>

<p>
For some moments the strange old man bent over
the woman in silence.  I was puzzled to discover her
identity.  Why had she been kept prisoner in that
gilded cabin during the cruise?  Why had we
remained in total ignorance of her presence?  I alone
knew our host's secret.  We had a dead woman on
board.
</p>

<p>
Keppel touched the woman again, placing his
hand upon her face.  When he withdrew it, I saw
that blood was upon it.  He looked at it, and
shudderingly wiped it off upon his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant a voice, that of a man,
sounded from the opposite side of the cabin, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see that the ventilator is open up
above?  Shut it, or somebody may see us.  They
can see down here from the bridge."
</p>

<p>
"Think of her," the old man exclaimed, in a low
voice.  "Not of us."
</p>

<p>
"Of her?  Why should I?" inquired the gruff
voice of the unseen.  "You've killed her, and must
take the consequences."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;" gasped the old man, staggering with
difficulty to his feet, and placing both hands to his
eyes, as though to shut out from view that hideous
evidence of his crime.  "Yes," he cried, in an
awe-stricken tone, "she is dead!"
</p>

<p>
"And a good job, too," responded the unseen
man, in a hard and pitiless tone.
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Keppel angrily.  "At least respect
her memory.  Remember who she was!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall remember nothing of this night's work,"
the other responded.  "I leave all memories of
it as a legacy to you."
</p>

<p>
"You coward!" cried Keppel, turning upon the
speaker, his eyes flashing.  "I have endeavoured to
assist you, and this is your gratitude."
</p>

<p>
"Assist me?" sneered his companion.  "Pretty
assistance it's been!  I tell you what it is, Benjamin
Keppel, you're in a very tight place just now.  You
killed that&mdash;that woman there, and you know
what the penalty is for murder."
</p>

<p>
"I know!" wailed the white-faced, despairing man.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I might be permitted to advise, I'd make
a clean sweep of the whole affair," said the man.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply this: we can't keep the body very long
in this cabin without it being discovered.  And
when it is found, well, it will be all up with both of
us.  Of that there's but little doubt.  I suggest
this.  Let us make at once for one of the Italian
ports, say Leghorn, where you will land to transact
some important business, and I'll land also.  Then
the <i>Vispera</i> will sail for Naples, to which port you
will go by rail to rejoin her.  On the way, however,
the vessel disappears&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Disappears!  How?  I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Is blown up."
</p>

<p>
"Blown up!" he cried.  "And how about the guests?"
</p>

<p>
"Guests be hanged!"
</p>

<p>
"But there are eleven of them, beside the crew."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind them.  There are the boats, and
no doubt they'll all take care of themselves.  Fools
if they don't."
</p>

<p>
"I should feel that I'd murdered them all,"
the old man responded.
</p>

<p>
"In this affair we must save ourselves,"
declared the unseen man, very firmly.  "There has
been a&mdash;well, we'll call it an ugly occurrence
to-night, and it behoves us to get clear out of it.  If the
<i>Vispera</i> goes down, the body will go down with
it, and the sea will hide our secret."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot imperil the lives of all in that
manner.  Besides, by what means do you suggest
destroying the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly simple.  Just give orders to Davis in
the morning to put in at Leghorn with all possible
speed, and leave the rest to me.  I'll guarantee
that the <i>Vispera</i> will never reach Naples."  Then
he added: "But just shut that infernal ventilator.
I don't like it being open."
</p>

<p>
Old Keppel, staggering, reached the cord, and in
obedience to his companion's wish closed the narrow
opening with a sudden bang.  The woodwork
narrowly escaped coming into contact with my
face, and for some moments I remained there
clutching at my unstable supports, and rudely
buffeted by the gale.
</p>

<p>
As at any moment I might be discovered, I made
haste to lower myself again to the deck, though not
without difficulty, and then cautiously returned to
my own cabin.
</p>

<p>
I had been soaked to the skin by the rain and
spray, but though still in my wet things, I sat
pondering over the mysterious crime I had discovered.
</p>

<p>
Who was that unseen man?  Whoever he was, he
held old Benjamin Keppel in his power, and to his
diabolical plot would be due the destruction of the
<i>Vispera</i>, and the loss of perhaps every soul on board.
</p>

<p>
He had suggested an explosion.  He no doubt
intended to place on board some infernal contrivance
which, after the lapse of a certain number of
hours, would explode, and blow the bottom out of
the yacht.  Whoever that man was, he was a crafty
villain.  Providentially, however, I had been led
to the discovery of the scheme, and I did not mean
that the lives of my fellow-guests, or of the crew,
should be sacrificed in order to conceal a crime.
</p>

<p>
A vision of that white dead face recurred to me.
It was a face very handsome, but to my remembrance
I had never seen it before.  The mystery of
the woman's concealment there was altogether
extraordinary.  Yet it scarcely seemed possible that she
should have remained in hiding so long without a
soul on board, save Keppel, being aware of her
presence.  She had been fed, of course, and most
probably the steward knew of her presence in that
gilded deck-house.  But she was dead&mdash;murdered
by an inoffensive old gentleman, who was the very
last person in the would I should have suspected of
having taken human life.
</p>

<p>
And why had he stroked her dead face so
caressingly?  Who, indeed, was she?
</p>

<p>
My wet clothes clung to me coldly and clammily.
I now exchanged them for a warm wrap, entered
my berth, and tried to rest.  Sleep was, however,
impossible in that doomed ship, amid the wild
roaring of the tempest and the thunder of the waves
breaking over the deck above.  Once it occurred
to me to go straight to Ulrica and tell her all I had
seen and heard, but on reflection I resolved to keep
my own counsel, and narrowly watch the course of
events.
</p>

<p>
The mystery of the hidden man's identity grew
upon me, until I suddenly resolved to make a
further endeavour to discover him.  The voice was
deep and low, but the roaring of the wind and hissing
of escaping steam had prevented me hearing it
sufficiently well to recognise whether it was that
of one of our fellow-guests.  I slipped on a
mackintosh, returned to the deck, and crept towards the
cabin, wherein reposed the remains of the mysterious
woman in white.  But soon I saw that the light
had been switched off.  All was in darkness.  The
guilty pair had gone below to their own berths.
</p>

<p>
Through the whole night the storm continued, but
the morning broke brightly, and the tempest, as
is so frequently the case in the Mediterranean, was
succeeded by a dead calm, so that when we sat down
to breakfast we were steaming in comparatively
smooth water.
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard?" said Ulrica to me, after we
had been exchanging our sleepless experiences.
"Mr. Keppel has altered our course.  He has some
pressing business to attend to, so we are going into
Leghorn."
</p>

<p>
"Leghorn!" exclaimed Lord Eldersfield at my
elbow.  "Horrid place!  I was there once.  Narrow
streets, dirty people, primitive sanitation, and
a sorry attempt at a promenade."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we don't stay there long; that's one
comfort," said Ulrica.  "Mr. Keppel is going
ashore and he'll rejoin us at Naples."
</p>

<p>
I looked down the table and saw that the face of
the old millionaire was pale, without its usual
composure.  He was pretending to be busily occupied
with his porridge.
</p>

<p>
"Are we going on straight to Naples, Keppel?"
inquired Eldersfield.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," answered our host.  "I much regret
that I'm compelled to take you all out of our original
course, but I must exchange some telegrams with my
agent in London.  We shall be in Leghorn to-night,
and if you are all agreed, you may sail again at once."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to see Leghorn," declared Ulrica.
"People who go to Italy always leave it out of their
itinerary.  I've heard that it is quite charming
in many ways.  All the better-class Italians from
Florence and Rome go there for the bathing in
summer."
</p>

<p>
"Which, I fear, isn't much of a recommendation,"
observed his lordship, who was, I believe, Ulrica's
pet aversion.
</p>

<p>
"The bathing itself is declared by all the guide-books
to be the best in Europe," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"And the heat in summer greater than in any
other place on the Continent of Europe.  Its imports
are rags from Constantinople and codfish from
Newfoundland.  No wonder its scents do not all come
from roses."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  Of course, if you know the place
you are welcome to your own opinion.  I don't
know it."
</p>

<p>
"When you do, Miss Yorke, you'll share my
opinion.  Of that I feel certain," he laughed; and
then continued his meal.
</p>

<p>
The question was shortly decided by vote whether
the <i>Vispera</i> should remain at Leghorn or not.
By the majority of the guests, Leghorn was supposed
to be merely a dirty seaport, and although I,
who knew the place well, tried to impress upon them
that it possessed many charms not to be found in
other Italian towns, it was decided that the yacht
should only remain there a day, and then go straight
on to Naples.
</p>

<p>
This decision was disconcerting.  I had to prevent
the trip southward, and the problem of how to
do so without arousing suspicion was an extremely
difficult one to solve.  If the vessel sailed from
Leghorn, then she was doomed, together with every
soul on board.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
IN WHICH I MAKE A RESOLVE
</h3>

<p>
The great broad plain which lies between marble-built
Pisa and the sea was flooded by the golden
Italian sunset, and the background of the serrated
Apennines loomed a dark purple in the distance
as we approached the long breakwater which protects
Leghorn from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Leaning over the rail, I gazed upon the white
sun-blanched Tuscan town, and recognised the gay
Passeggio, with its avenue of dusky tamarisks, its
long rows of high white houses, with their green
<i>persiennes</i>, and Pancaldi's, and other baths, built
out upon the rocks into the sea.  Years ago, when at
the convent, we had gone there each summer, a
dozen or so girls at a time, under the care of Suor
Angelica, to obtain fresh air and escape for a
fortnight or so from the intolerable heat of July in
the Val d'Ema.  How well I remembered that long
promenade, the Viale Regina Margherita, best known
to those happy, light-hearted, improvident Livornesi
by its ancient name, the Passeggio!  And what
long walks we girls used to have over the rocks
beyond Antignano, or scrambling climbs up to the
shrine of the miracle-working Virgin at Montenero!
Happy, indeed, were those summer days with my
girl friends&mdash;girls who had now, like myself, grown
to be women&mdash;who had married, and had experienced
all the trials and bitterness of life.  I thought of
her who was my best friend in those past days&mdash;pretty,
black-haired, unassuming Annetta Ceriani,
from Arezzo.  She had left the college the same
week as myself, and our parting had been a very
sad one.  In a year, however, she had married, and
was now a princess, the wife of Romolo Annibale
Cesare Sigismondo, Prince Regello, who, to give him
all his titles, was "principe Romano, principe di
Pinerolo, conte di Lucca, nobile di Monte Catini."  Truly,
the Italian nobility do not lack titles.  But
poor Annetta!  Her life had been the reverse of
happy, and the last letter I had received from her,
dated from Venice, contained the story of a woman
heart-broken.
</p>

<p>
Yes, as I stood there on the deck of the <i>Vispera</i>,
approaching the old sun-whitened Tuscan port,
many were the recollections of those long-past
careless days which crowded upon me&mdash;days before
I had known how weary was the world, or how
fraught with bitterness was woman's love.
</p>

<p>
Already the light was shining yellow in the square
old lighthouse, although the sun had not altogether
disappeared.  Half-a-dozen fine cruisers of the
British Mediterranean Squadron were lying at
anchor in line, and we passed several boats full of
sun-tanned men on the way to the shore for an
evening promenade, for the British sailor is always
a welcome guest in Leghorn.
</p>

<p>
The situation was becoming desperate.  How
was I to act?  At least, I should now ascertain
who had been the old man's companion in the
deck-cabin on the previous night, for he and this
stranger would no doubt go ashore together.
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Keppel was standing near me, speaking
again to the captain, giving him certain orders, when
Gerald, spruce as usual in blue serge, came up and
leaned at my side.
</p>

<p>
"Ulrica says you know Leghorn quite well.
You must be our guide.  We're all going ashore
after dinner.  What is there to amuse one in the
evening?"
</p>

<p>
"There is opera at the Goldoni always.  One pays
only four lire for a box to seat six," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" he laughed incredulously.  "I
shouldn't care to sit out music at that price."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there I must differ," I replied.  "It is as
good as any you'll find in Italy.  Remember, here
is the home of opera.  Why, the Livornesi love music
so intensely that it is no unusual occurrence for a
poor family to make shift with a piece of bread and
an onion for dinner, so as to save the fifty centesimi
ingresso to the opera.  Mascagni is Livornese, and
Puccini, who composed La Boheme, was also born
close here.  In 'cara Livorno,' as the Tuscan loves
to call it, one can hear the best opera for five-pence."
</p>

<p>
"Compare that with prices in London!"
</p>

<p>
"And our music, unfortunately, is not so good,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go to this delightfully inexpensive
opera to-night?  It would certainly be an experience."
</p>

<p>
"I fear I shall not," I answered.  "I'm not
feeling very well."
</p>

<p>
"I'm extremely sorry," he said, with quick
apprehension.  "Is there anything I can get you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing, thank you," I answered.  "I feel
a little faint, that's all."
</p>

<p>
We had already anchored just inside the breakwater,
and those very inquisitive gentlemen&mdash;the
Italian Customs officers&mdash;had come on board.  A
few minutes later the bell rang for dinner, and all
descended to the saloon, eager to get the meal over
and go ashore.
</p>

<p>
On the way down Ulrica took me aside.
</p>

<p>
"Gerald has told me you are ill, my dear.  I've
noticed how pale and unlike yourself you've been all
day.  What's the matter?  Tell me."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I can't.  At least, not now," I managed to
stammer, as I hastened to slip from her side.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to be alone to think.  Keppel's
companion of the previous night, the man to whom the
conception of that diabolical plot was due, was still
on board.  But who was he?
</p>

<p>
I ate nothing, and was ready to take my seat
in the first boat that went ashore.  I had excused
myself from making one of the party at the opera,
after giving all necessary directions, and, on
pretence of going to a chemist's to make a purchase,
I separated myself from Ulrica, Gerald, and Lord
Eldersfield in the Via Grande, the principal thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
How next to act I knew not.  No doubt Keppel's
intention was to send on board some explosive
destined to sink the <i>Vispera</i> to the bottom with all on
board.  At all hazards, the yacht must not sail.
Yet, how was it possible that I could prevent it
without making a full statement of what I had
overheard?
</p>

<p>
I entered the pharmacy and purchased the first
article that came into my mind.  Then, returning
into the street, I wandered on, plunged in my own
distracting thoughts.  Keppel had gone alone to
the telegraph office in a cab.
</p>

<p>
The soft, balmy Italian night had fallen, and the
white streets and piazzas of Leghorn were filled,
as they always are at evening, with the light-hearted
crowds of idlers; men with their hats stuck jauntily
askew, smoking, laughing, gossiping; and women,
dark-haired, black-eyed, the most handsome in all
Italy, each with a mantilla of black lace or some
light-coloured silk as head-covering, promenading
and enjoying the <i>bel fresco</i> after the toil and burden
of the day.  None in all the world can surpass in
beauty the Tuscan women&mdash;dark, tragic, with eyes
that flash quickly in love or hatred, with figures
perfect, and each with an easy-swinging gait that a
duchess might envy.  It was Suor Angelica who
had once repeated to me the verse written about
them by an old Florentine poet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "S'è grande, è oziosa,<br>
  S'è piccola, è viziosa;<br>
  S'è, bella, è vanitosa;<br>
  S'è brutta, è fastidiosa."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Every type, indeed, is represented in that long,
single street at night&mdash;the dark-haired Jewess, the
classic Greek, the thick-lipped Tunisian, the
pale-cheeked Armenian, and the beautiful Tuscan, the
purest type of beauty in all the world.
</p>

<p>
Once again, after several years, I heard, as I
walked onward, the soft sibilations of the Tuscan
tongue about me, the gay chatter of that city of
sun and sea, where, although half the population
is in a state of semi-starvation, hearts are still as
light as in the days when "cara Livorno" was still
prosperous.  But alas! it has sadly declined.  Its
manufactures, never very extensive, have died cut;
its merchant princes are ruined, or have deserted
it, and its trade has ebbed until there is no work
for those honest, brown-faced men, who are forced
to idle upon the stone benches in the piazza, even
though their wives and children are crying for
bread.
</p>

<p>
The splendid band of the garrison was playing in
the great Piazza Vittorio, in front of the British
Consulate, where the Consular flag was waving,
because the warships were in the port.  The music
was in acknowledgment of the fact that the British
Marine Band had played before the Prefecture on
the previous evening.  The Consulate was
illuminated, and on the balcony, in company with a
large party, was the Consul himself, the popular
Jack Hutchinson&mdash;known to every English and
American resident throughout Tuscany as the
merriest and happiest of good fellows, as well as
a distinguished author and critic.  I recognised
him, looking cool in his suit of white linen, but
hurried on across the great square, feeling that no
time should be lost, and yet not knowing what
to do.
</p>

<p>
The mysterious assassination of poor Reggie, and
the curious events which followed, coupled with the
startling discovery I had made on the previous night,
had completely unnerved me.  As I tried to reflect
calmly and logically, I came to the conclusion that
it was eminently necessary to ascertain the identity
of the man who held the millionaire beneath his
thumb&mdash;the man who had suggested the blowing up
of the yacht.  This man intended, without a doubt,
to leave the vessel under cover of night; or, if he
were actually one of the guests, he could, of course,
easily excuse himself and leave the others, as I
had done.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
IN WHICH WE PAY A VISIT ASHORE
</h3>

<p>
The mystery of the deck cabin was puzzling.
</p>

<p>
I alone held knowledge of the dastardly plan
formed to blow up the yacht, and was determined
that the vessel should not sail again before I had
warned my fellow-guests.  But how?
</p>

<p>
I had watched the old millionaire narrowly, and
had plainly detected his nervous agitation, and his
anxiety for the cruise to be brought to an end.  As
far as I myself was concerned, I had no intention of
again sailing in the <i>Vispera</i>, and would certainly
not allow Ulrica to continue the voyage.  That the
yacht was doomed was plain.  Even at that moment
old Mr. Keppel was sending mysterious telegrams,
in all of which I scented some connection with the
tragedy that had occurred on board.  It struck me
that the wisest course would be to attach myself to
my host as much as possible, and narrowly watch
his movements.  With that intention, therefore, I
turned back and walked as far as the great Piazza
Carlo Alberto, where the central telegraph office
was situated.  On the stone seats around the
spacious square hundreds of people were sitting
and gossiping beneath the stars, for the Italian of
the working-class loves to gossip at night, when the
day's toil is over, and the cool breeze comes in from
across the sea.
</p>

<p>
I met Keppel emerging from the office, and with
some surprise he greeted me.  I told him that I
had been making some purchases, while the others
had gone to the opera, whereupon he suggested that
we, too, should take a cab to the Goldoni and join
the party there.
</p>

<p>
This we did.  The old man was unusually chatty
and affable, and during our drive told me he had
decided that the <i>Vispera</i> should lie in Leghorn for
the next five or six days, as he was expecting letters
from England in reply to the telegrams he had just
despatched.
</p>

<p>
This surprised me.  If he and his unknown
accomplice wished to get rid of traces of their
crime by blowing up the vessel, it seemed only
probable that they would do so at the earliest possible
moment.  Again, a second point was an enigma.
How was it that the Customs officers, who had
searched the yacht, and had, of course, entered the
mysterious deck-house, had not discovered the
crime?
</p>

<p>
Keppel was a very shrewd old fellow, but it was
my duty to prevent the consummation of the
dastardly plot which his accomplice had suggested.
With this object in view, I made a point of
remaining as near him as possible.
</p>

<p>
In the investigation of matters such as these a
woman is in many ways handicapped.  A man can
go hither and thither in search of truth, and act
in a manner for which a woman can find no excuse.
</p>

<p>
At the Goldoni, an enormous theatre, rather dingy
with age, but nevertheless comfortable, Verdi's
<i>Aida</i> was being performed, and when we entered the
box occupied by our party, Ulrica greeted me with
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"You were quite right, Carmela, dear.  The
music is really wonderful.  I had no idea that they
had opera of such high quality in a small Italian
town.  The tenor is a great artist."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I laughed.  "I was sneered at when I
dared to say that there was anything of interest in
Leghorn.  You have at least found an evening's
amusement equal to any you'll find in London.
Pretty toilettes you won't find, as at Covent Garden,
but good opera you can always hear."
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with Miss Rosselli," declared
Gerald, as he rose to give me his seat.  "Leghorn
is a charming place.  And what lovely women!
I've never in all my life seen such a galaxy of
beauty."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then you have noticed them already!" I
said, smiling at his enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Every Englishman who goes to Leghorn is
enthusiastic over the beauty of the Livornese women,
the well-cut, regular features, the dark flashing
eyes, the artistically-dressed hair, the great
gold-loop ear-rings, and the soft santuzza, or silken
scarf, with embroidered ends, wound about the head
and secured by great pins, the finishing touch to a
thoroughly artistic adornment.
</p>

<p>
As the Englishman walks down the Via Grande,
they, promenading in couples or threes, arm in
arm, turn and laugh saucily at him as he passes.
Yes, they are a light-hearted, careless people, the
Livornesi, even though the poverty is terrible.
Hundreds would die of sheer starvation yearly were
it not for those kind Capuchins, Fra Antonio, Padre
Sisto, Padre Antonino, and the others, who daily
distribute bread to all who ask for it at the convent
gate.  The good friars have no funds, but Fra
Orazio, a lay brother, and the youngest of them,
goes daily from house to house of the middle classes
and the wealthy, begging a trifle here and a trifle
there with which to buy the bread and the necessaries
for soup for the starving.  And who does not
know Fra Orazio in Leghorn?  In his brown habit,
a dark-haired, black-bearded man of forty, with a
round, jovial face tanned by the sun, his rotund
figure is as well known as the equestrian statue of
Vittorio Emanuele in the Piazza.
</p>

<p>
The theatre was crowded, the cheaper parts being
packed by men and women of the poorer classes,
who had made that day one of semi-fasting in order
to be able to pay the <i>ingresso</i>, and hear the music
of their beloved <i>maestro</i>.  The audience was an
enthusiastic one, as it generally is in Italy&mdash;as quick
to praise as it is to condemn&mdash;and that night the
principal singers were recalled time after time.  In
the Italian theatre there is a lack of luxury;
sometimes even the floor is unswept, and there is dust in
the boxes; nevertheless, all these drawbacks are
counterbalanced by the excellence of the performance.
</p>

<p>
To the millionaire's guests that performance was
a revelation, and when we left on the conclusion of
the opera to return to the port and go on board,
Leghorn was voted by all to be quite an interesting
place.  Indeed, when our host stated that he
intended to remain there a few days owing to the
necessities of his business, no one demurred.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica suggested at breakfast next morning that
some of us should run up to Florence on a flying
visit, it being only sixty miles distant, while
somebody else urged the formation of a party to go and
see the famed leaning tower at Pisa.  For my part,
however, I had resolved that I would go wherever
my host went.  Several times that morning I
passed and repassed the deck-cabin, but those
green silk blinds were closely drawn across the
brass-bound port-holes, and the door was carefully
locked.
</p>

<p>
What a terrible mystery was contained therein!
If only my fellow-guests were aware that on board
the vessel was the body of an unknown woman
who had been foully and brutally murdered!
And yet a distinct suspicion had now seized me
that the Customs officers, having searched and
found nothing, the body must have been secretly
disposed of.  Perhaps it had been weighted and
sunk during the silent watches of the night.
</p>

<p>
Yet, if this had actually been done, what possible
reason was there to destroy the yacht and sacrifice
the lives of those on board?  I had thought it all
over very carefully in the privacy of my own small
cabin, where the morning sunshine, dancing upon
the water lying just below my port-hole, cast
tremulous reflections upon the roof of the cosy little
chamber.  No solution of the problem, however,
presented itself.  I was utterly bewildered.  A
thousand times I was tempted to confide in Ulrica,
yet on reflection I saw how giddy she was, and
feared that she might blurt it out to one or other
of her friends.  She was sadly indiscreet where
secrets were concerned.
</p>

<p>
About ten o'clock I found the old millionaire
lolling back in a deck-chair, enjoying his morning
cigar according to habit, and in order to watch
him, I sank into another chair close to his.  The
<i>Vispera</i> was lying within the semi-circular mole;
and so, while protected from the sudden gales for
which that coast is so noted, there was, nevertheless,
presented from her deck a magnificent panorama
of the sun-blanched town and the range of dark
mountains beyond.
</p>

<p>
"The young Countess Bonelli, who was at school
with me, has invited us all to her villa at Ardenza,"
I said, as I seated myself.  "You will accompany
us this afternoon, won't you, Mr. Keppel?"
</p>

<p>
"Ardenza?  Where's that?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"The white village there, along the coast," I
answered, pointing it out to him.  "I sent a
message to the Countess last night, and half an
hour ago I received a most pressing invitation for
all of us to drive out to her villa to tea.  You'll
come?  We shall accept no excuses," I added.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Miss Rosselli," he grunted, "I'm getting
old and crochety; and to tell you the plain truth,
I hate tea-parties."
</p>

<p>
"But you men won't drink tea, of course," I
said.  "The Countess is most hospitable.  She's
one of the best known of the younger hostesses in
Florence.  You probably know the Bonelli Palace
in the Via Montebello.  They always spend the
spring and autumn at their villa at Ardenza."
</p>

<p>
And so I pressed the old man until he could not
refuse.  I watched him very narrowly during our
conversation, and became more than ever convinced
that his increased anxiety and fidgety behaviour
were due to the pricks of conscience.  More than
once I felt sorely tempted to speak straight out,
and demand of him who and where was the woman
who had been concealed in that gilded deck-house?
</p>

<p>
But what would it profit to act ridiculously?
Only by patience and the exercise of woman's wit
could I hope to learn the truth.
</p>

<p>
His reluctance to go ashore increased my
suspicions.  He had at breakfast announced his
intention of not landing before evening, as he had
some correspondence to attend to; but this seemed
a mere excuse to remain behind while the others
went out exploring the town.  Therefore I was
determined that he should accompany us, and I
had urged Ulrica to add her persuasive powers to
mine.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was one of those brilliant ones which
are almost incessant on the Tuscan coast.  About
three o'clock we all landed, including the old
millionaire, and in cabs were driven along the promenade
and out by the city gate along the oleander grove
to Ardenza, the first village eastward beyond
Leghorn on the ancient Strada Romana, that long
highway which runs from Marseilles to Rome.
</p>

<p>
All in the party were delighted with the drive
along that wide sea-road, which for miles is divided
from the actual rocks by a belt of well-kept gardens
of palms and oleanders, forming one of the
handsomest and most beautiful promenades in the South
of Europe.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought it curious that the ubiquitous
British traveller has never discovered Ardenza.  He
will, no doubt, some day, and then the fortune of
the charming little retreat will be made.  Time was,
and not very long ago, when Nervi, Santa
Margherita, and Rapallo were unknown to those
fortunate ones who follow the sun in winter; yet
already all those little places are rapidly becoming
fashionable, and big hotels are springing up
everywhere.  The fact is, that <i>habitués</i> of the South,
becoming tired of the artificiality and flagrant vice
of the French Riviera, and of the terrible rapaciousness
of hotel-keepers and tradesmen in that most
ghastly of all Riviera resorts, San Remo, are
gradually moving farther eastward, where the sunshine
is the same, but where the people are charming
and as yet unspoilt by the invading hordes of the
wealthy; where the breezes are health-giving,
where the country is both picturesque and primitive,
and where the Aspasia of the boulevard and the
<i>chevalier d'industrie</i> are alike absent.
</p>

<p>
Ardenza is a large village of great white villas
in the Italian style&mdash;mansions they would be called
in England.  Some face the splendid tree-lined
promenade, but many lie back from the sea in their
own grounds, shut out from the vulgar gaze by walls
high and prison-like.  There is no mean street,
for it is essentially a village of the wealthy, where
the great houses, with their wonderful mosaic floors,
are the acme of comfort and convenience, where both
streets and houses are lit by electricity, and where
society is extremely sociable, and yet select.
</p>

<p>
There is neither shop nor hotel in the place, but
a quarter of a mile away is the old village called
Ardenza di Terra, to distinguish it from that by
the sea, a typical Italian village, with its old-world
fountain, round which the women, gay in their
bright kerchiefs, gossip; its picturesque bridge, and
its long white high-road which leads up to Montenero,
that high, dark hill on which stands the church with
its miracle-working Virgin.  Both Byron and Shelley
knew and appreciated the beauties of the place.
The former had a villa close by, which is,
alas! now falling to decay; while Shelley frequently
visited Antignano, the next village along the old
sea-road.
</p>

<p>
Better than San Remo, better than Bordighera,
better than Alassio, Ardenza will one day, when
enterprising hotel-keepers discover it, and the new
direct railway from Genoa to Rome is constructed
from Viareggio to Cecina, become a rival to Nice.
At present, however, the residents are extremely
conservative.  They never seek to advertise the beauties
or advantages of the place, for they have no desire
that it should become a popular resort.  Nevertheless,
I dare to assert here that the sea-bathing is
perhaps the finest in Europe, that no promenade of
any English watering-place equals it, and that its
climate, save in the month of August, is one of the
best of any place on the Mediterranean shore.
</p>

<p>
No wonder, then, that rich Italians have built
their villas in so lovely a spot, or that they go there
to escape the fogs of the Arno, or the dreaded
malaria of Rome.
</p>

<p>
The Countess Velia met me at the port, and
carried Ulrica and myself home in her smart victoria.
We had not met for quite three years, and I saw
that the rather plain Velia of convent days had
now grown into a strikingly handsome woman.
Her husband, she told us, was unfortunately in
Venice.
</p>

<p>
The Villa Bonelli we found to be one of the largest
in Ardenza, a huge white mansion, with bright green
<i>persiennes</i>, standing back in its own grounds behind
a large gate of ornamental iron, the spikes being
gilded, in accordance with the usual style in Italy.
Velia received her guests in the great <i>salon</i>
upholstered in azure silk, and then we wandered through
the ground floor of the spacious mansion, passing
the smaller <i>salons</i>, and at last strolled out into the
garden, where tea was served in the English style
under the shadow of the orange trees.  Velia had
never been able to master English, and, as few of
her guests beside myself spoke Italian, her conversation
was of necessity limited.  Nevertheless, after
a five weeks' cruise, resulting in the cramped
sensation one usually experiences while yachting,
tea-drinking and rambling in that beautiful garden,
with its wealth of flowers, were delightful occupations
enjoyed by all, even by old Mr. Keppel, whose
chief wonder seemed to be at the magnificence of the
house, which appeared to be almost entirely
constructed of marble.  The mosaic floors, too, were
splendid, worked in dark green and white, in
imitation of those in the Thermæ Antoninianæ at Rome.
The Bonellis were an ancient family, one of the
few Florentine nobles who were still wealthy.
Their ancestral castello was above Pracchia in the
Apennines, between Florence and Bologna, and Velia
had several times since her marriage given me
pressing invitations to stay with her there.
</p>

<p>
At the convent we had always been close friends.
She was the daughter of the Marchese Palidoro of
Ancona, and once I had spent the Easter vacation
with her at her home on the Adriatic shore.  Ulrica
and the others found her a charming little woman,
and, of course, admired the two-year-old little
Count, who was brought down from his kingdom
in the nursery, to be kissed and admired by us.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
DISCUSSES SEVERAL MATTERS OF MOMENT
</h3>

<p>
The men drank Marsala&mdash;always offered in the
afternoon in an Italian house&mdash;and smoked in the
garden, while we women wandered wherever we
liked.  Those of my companions who had not before
seen the interior of an Italian villa were interested
in everything, even to the culinary arrangements, so
different from those in England.  The Italian cook
makes his dishes over some half-a-dozen small charcoal
fires about the size of one's hand, which he keeps
burning by a kind of rush fire-screen, the English
grate being unknown.
</p>

<p>
We had been there a couple of hours, and to all
of us the change had been pleasant after so long a
spell at sea.  Velia was sitting apart in the garden,
and we were chatting, she telling me of the perfect
tranquillity of her married life.  Rino was, she
declared, a model husband, and she was perfectly
happy; indeed, her life was a realisation of those
dreams that we both used to have long ago in the
old neglected garden of the convent, when we
walked together hand-in-hand at sundown.
</p>

<p>
She recalled those days to me&mdash;days when I, in my
childish ignorance, believed the world outside to be
filled with pleasant things.  We had not met since
we had parted at the convent, she to enter Florentine
society and to marry, and I to drift about the world
in search of a husband.
</p>

<p>
"Suor Teresa's counsels were so very true," she
said to me, as we recalled the grey-eyed Sister who
had been our foster-mother.  "Haven't you found
them so, just as I have, even though you have lived
in England, your cold, undemonstrative England,
and I here, in Italia?"
</p>

<p>
"Suor Teresa gave us so much good advice.
To which of her precepts do you refer?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you recollect how she was always saying
that, as women, the first thing of importance was
always to be content to be inferior to men&mdash;inferior
in mental power in the same proportion as we are
inferior in bodily strength.  Facility of movement,
aptitude and grace, the bodily frame of woman may
possess in a higher degree than that of man; just as
in the softer touches of mental and spiritual beauty
her character may present a lovelier aspect than
his.  Yet the woman will find, Suor Teresa used to
say, that she is by nature endowed with peculiar
faculties&mdash;with a quickness of perception, facility
of adaptation, and acuteness of feeling, which fit her
especially for the part she has to act in life, and
which, at the same time, render her, in a higher
degree than man, susceptible both to pain and
pleasure.  These, according to our good Sister, are our
qualifications as mere women."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "I remember now.  Some of Suor
Teresa's counsels I've followed, but others, I fear,
I threw to the winds.  She was a good woman&mdash;a
very good woman, Suor Teresa.  Do you remember
how she used to lecture us girls, and say: 'When you
are women of the world, how wide is the prospect
which opens before you&mdash;how various the claims
upon your attention&mdash;how vast your capabilities&mdash;how
deep the responsibility which those capabilities
involve!  In the first place, you are not alone;
you are one of a family&mdash;of a social circle&mdash;of a
community&mdash;of a nation.  You are a being whose
existence will never terminate, who must live for
ever, and whose happiness or misery through that
endless future which lies before you will be influenced
by the choice you are now in the act of making.'  Do
you remember the kind of lectures she used to
give us?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly well," answered Velia.  "But she is
dead, poor woman; she died of fever last summer."
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" I echoed
</p>

<p>
A pang of regret shot through my heart, for I
remembered how sweet and kind she had always
been, how just and how devout in all her religion.
To her I owed many stimulating ideas about good
and evil, few of which, I fear, remained long enough
in my memory.  It was she who taught me to
love the virtuous and the good, and the recollection
of those early days of her tender guidance formed
a bright spot in my life, to which, I suppose, the
mind will take me back at intervals as long as
existence lasts.
</p>

<p>
Velia was about my own age, and at the convent
we had treated one another as if we were sisters.
Therefore when we fell to talking of those old days
before the courses of our lives ran so far apart, my
memory drifted back to those home-truths which
Suor Teresa and her fellow-nuns had striven to
instil into our rather fickle minds.
</p>

<p>
My fellow-guests left about five o'clock, for they
had arranged to continue on the sea-road and ascend
to the famed pilgrimage church of Montenero&mdash;one
of the sights of Western Tuscany.  As I had
made a pilgrimage there in my school-days, at
Velia's invitation I remained behind to dine with
her, promising Ulrica to return on board later in
the evening.
</p>

<p>
In the glorious blaze of crimson sunset which
flooded the broad, clear Mediterranean, causing the
islands of Gorgona, Capraja, and Corsica to stand out
in purple grandeur in the infinite blaze of gold, I sat
upon the marble terrace, lolling in a long cane chair,
and chatting with the Countess.
</p>

<p>
How different had been our lives, I reflected.
She, married happily, surrounded by every comfort
that wealth could provide, a child which was her
idol, and a husband whom she adored; while I,
one of those unattached women who form the flotsam
of society, world-weary, forlorn, and forsaken, was
beaten hither and thither up and down Europe by
every gust of the social wind.
</p>

<p>
I contrasted our lives, and found my own to be a
hollow and empty sham.  Of all the passions which
take possession of the female breast, a passion for
society is one of the most inimical to domestic
enjoyment.  Yet how often does this exist in
connection with an amiable exterior!  It is not easy
to say whether one ought most to pity or to blame a
woman who lives for society&mdash;a woman who reserves
all her good spirits, all her pretty frocks, her
animated looks, her interesting conversation, her bland
behaviour, her smiles, her forbearance, her
gentleness, for society.  What imposition does she not
practise upon those who meet her there!  Follow
the same individual home; she is impatient, fretful,
sullen, weary, oppressed with headache, uninterested
in all that passes around her, and dreaming only of
the last evening's excitement, or of what may
constitute the amusement of the next; while the
mortification of her friends at home is increased
by the contrast her behaviour exhibits in the two
different situations, and her expenditure upon
comparative strangers of feelings to which they
consider themselves to have a natural and inalienable
right.  I was terribly conscious of my own failings
in this respect, and in society Ulrica had been
my chief example.
</p>

<p>
I hated it all, and envied the woman who sat
there chatting with me so merrily.
</p>

<p>
There, in the fading afterglow, when the sun had
disappeared behind the distant headland, I told her,
in reply to her question, of my love and its
disillusionment.  I told her his name&mdash;Ernest Cameron&mdash;and
at mention of it I thought I detected her dark
brows grow narrow for an instant.  But surely it was
only fancy, for these two had certainly never met.
</p>

<p>
"You have all my sympathy, Carmela," she said,
in her soft Italian, when I had told her the truth.
"You have suffered, poor child.  Your words tell
me so."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I responded frankly.  "I have suffered,
and am still suffering.  Another woman stole his
love from me, and I am left deserted, forlorn;
outwardly a smart figure as you see me, but within
my heart is the canker-worm of hatred."
</p>

<p>
"He may return to you," she said.  "His fancy
may be a mere passing one.  Men are so very fickle."
</p>

<p>
"No," I declared quickly, "it is all ended between
us.  I loved only once&mdash;loved him with all the
charm of a first attachment.  She who entertains
this sentiment lives no longer for herself.  It was
so in my case.  In all my aspirations, my hopes,
my energies; in all my confidence, my enthusiasm,
my fortitude, my own existence was absorbed in his
interests.  But now I am despised and forgotten."
</p>

<p>
She was so sympathetic that more than once I was
tempted to confide to her the whole of the strange
facts and the mysteries that were so puzzling to
me.  But I hesitated&mdash;and in my hesitation
resolved to keep my own counsel.
</p>

<p>
We dined together, taking our wine from the big
rush-covered <i>fiasco</i> of Chianti placed in its swinging
stand, according to the custom of Tuscany; eating
various dishes peculiarly Italian, and being waited
upon by two maids who spoke in that quaint but
musical dialect of the Tuscan shore.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the meal my thoughts wandered from
my surroundings to the dastardly plot formed to
destroy the <i>Vispera</i>.  Where, I wondered, was old
Mr. Keppel?  For aught I knew, both he and his
unseen accomplice were engaged in buying explosives
for the purpose of causing the contemplated disaster.
</p>

<p>
Velia believed my preoccupation to be due to our
conversation before dinner, and I allowed her to
continue in that belief.
</p>

<p>
Dinner in an Italian household is a very different
meal to the French <i>table d'hôte</i> or the English evening
meal.  The courses are varied, and from the <i>anti-pasti</i>
to the <i>dolci</i>, all is new to the English palate.
Those who have lived sufficiently long in Italy to
become imbued with its charm know well how difficult
it is to relish the substantial English cooking
when one goes on a visit to the old country; just
as difficult as it is to enjoy the grey skies and smoky
cities of money-making Britain after the brightness
and sunshine of the garden of Europe.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock, after we had idled in the <i>salon</i>
with our coffee and certosa&mdash;a <i>liqueur</i> made by the
old monks of the Certosa, outside Florence, and
not obtainable beyond the confines of Tuscany&mdash;Velia's
brougham came round, and reluctantly I
took leave of her.
</p>

<p>
Our reunion had certainly been full of charm, for
in those hours I had allowed myself to forget my
present position, and had, in thought, drifted back
to the placid days of long ago that had been passed
within the high grey walls of the ancient convent.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Carmela," Velia said, holding my
hand in hers warmly after I had entered the carriage.
"Remember your promise to return here before
you sail.  I shall expect you."
</p>

<p>
I repeated my promise gaily, and then giving her
a final "<i>Addio, e buona notte,</i>" I was driven out of
the great gates and into the night.
</p>

<p>
The road from Ardenza to Leghorn, a magnificent
drive by day, is not very safe at night.  The trees
lining it form a refuge for any thieves or footpads,
and because of this it is patrolled continually by a
pair of mounted carbineers.
</p>

<p>
At length we came to the great iron gates of the
city, which stretch across the wide highway,
flanked on either side by huge porticos, in which
are stationed the officers of the dazio, as the <i>octroi</i>
in Italy is called.
</p>

<p>
Every article entering an Italian city is inspected
with a view to the imposition of taxes, hence every
conveyance, from the country cart of the contadino
laden with vegetables for the market, to the private
brougham, is stopped at the barrier, and the
occupant is asked to declare what he or she has with
him.
</p>

<p>
In front of the barrier the brougham was brought
to a halt, and one of the dazio guards, in his peaked
cap and long overcoat with silver facings, opened
the door, inquiring whether I had anything liable
to be taxed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Niente,</i>" I responded, and was preparing to
resettle myself for the journey, when the man, looking
rather hard at me in the semi-darkness, said:
</p>

<p>
"The signorina is named Rosselli, I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied, surprised at the man's
knowledge of my name.
</p>

<p>
He fumbled in the pocket of his overcoat for a
moment, produced a letter, and then handed it to
me in quite a surreptitious manner, saying in a low
tone:
</p>

<p>
"This is for the signorina."
</p>

<p>
Then he banged to the door with a great show of
officiousness, without waiting for me to thank him,
and we drove forward along the deserted promenade.
</p>

<p>
As it was quite dark within the carriage, I was
unable to read the communication that had so
suddenly been handed to me.
</p>

<p>
What, I wondered, did it contain?  Who had
taken the precaution to bribe one of the dazio
guards to hand it to me?

Surely it must contain something of the highest

CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
DESCRIBES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE
</h3>

<p>
At the outlying suburb of San Jacopo the street-lamps
began, and tearing open the strange note, I
found it to contain some lines penned in a rather
uneducated hand.
</p>

<p>
As the coachman was driving at a good pace, I
had some difficulty in deciphering the words by the
light of the street-lamps as their rays flashed in,
and as rapidly disappeared.  The words I read,
however, were decidedly curious.  Written in
Italian, rather faintly, be it said, the note ran as
follows:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"The bearer will give you this in strictest secrecy.
Do not return on board the yacht, but first call at
Number 12, Via Magenta, ground floor, where you
will meet a friend whose interests are identical with
your own.  Dismiss your carriage near the port,
and take a cab to the address indicated.  Come,
without fear, and without delay."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The invitation was, to say the least of it, a peculiar
one.  Although a woman, I am not naturally timid,
especially in Italy, where I know the language,
and know the peculiarities of the people.  My
first feelings, however, were those of suspicion.
Why could not the writer have approached me
openly, without taking the elaborate precaution of
sending me the missive by the hand of the dazio
guard?  Again, I was not acquainted with the
Via Magenta, and suspected it to be in a low
quarter of the city.  There are several parts of
Leghorn into which a woman would certainly not
care to venture after dark.
</p>

<p>
The suggestion that I should not return to the
yacht read to me as a warning, especially in the
light of the knowledge I had gained of old Keppel's
intentions.  Could it be possible that it was
intended that the <i>Vispera</i> should sail before morning
and go straight to her doom?
</p>

<p>
I sat back in the carriage, thinking it all over.
Finally, I came to the conclusion that the writer
of the letter, whoever he was, must, like myself,
be aware of the truth.  Our interests, he declared,
were identical.  That statement was in itself
interesting, and filled me with a curiosity which
increased as I reflected.  I glanced again at the sheet
of common notepaper in my hand, and my suspicions
were again aroused by the fact that there
was no signature.  The note was anonymous, and
no one, especially a woman, has any sympathy with
anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Should I disregard the warning, cast the letter
out of the carriage window, and return on board;
or should I act according to its instructions?
</p>

<p>
I was engaged in a very serious and difficult
inquiry, which had baffled experienced police
officials, be it remembered.  In every direction I
scented suspicion, now that the old millionaire,
the man in whose integrity I had so firmly believed,
was proved to be the author of a foul and dastardly
crime.  The whole affair was as startling as it was
incomprehensible.  The enigma was complete.
</p>

<p>
Ever since the time when I had been so cleverly
tricked by the pseudo-detectives in Nice, I had been
on the alert to discover some clue which might
lead me to a knowledge of the manner in which poor
Reggie had met with his death.  That there was a
deep-laid conspiracy on foot was manifest, but in
what direction to seek for an explanation, I knew
not.  The mystery of this strange affair unnerved me.
</p>

<p>
The city of Leghorn is bisected by the Via Grande,
its principal street, which runs from the great Piazza
Carlo Alberto in a straight line down to the port.
At the bottom of this thoroughfare I stopped the
brougham, alighted, and sent the conveyance back
to Ardenza.  The steps at which I knew the yacht's
boat would be awaiting me were a considerable
distance away, and I had no fear of detection by
any person who knew me.  At that hour all my
fellow-guests would undoubtedly be back on board;
therefore if I kept the strange appointment, I
might return to the yacht within an hour, and no
one need be the wiser.
</p>

<p>
From the open casement of one of the high, not
over-clean houses facing the port, where boatmen
and dock-labourers lived, sounded the sweet twanging
of a mandoline, while a voice sang an old Tuscan
serenade:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O!  Nina mia&mdash;o giovinetta,<br>
  Lunica speme&mdash;delta mia vita;<br>
  Deh! perchè vivi&mdash;così soletta<br>
  In questa tetra&mdash;stanza romita?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vieni, vieni!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vieni, deh! vieni a me d'accanto.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io t'amo tauto, io t'amo tanto!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I listened, and as those words of passionate love
fell upon my ears I tried to shut them out.  They
recalled too vividly the days when I myself had
been wooed by a man whom I loved.
</p>

<p>
The writer of the mysterious note had declared our
interests to be mutual.  This fact aroused my
interest, causing me, in my eagerness to learn the
truth, to disregard my usual caution.  Hailing one
of the small open cabs which are characteristic of
every Italian town, I gave the man the address
mentioned in the letter.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to my expectations, the Via Magenta
proved to be one of the principal streets down
which the electric tramway passed, and Number 12
was, I found, a large, old palace of six stories, once
the residence of some count or marquis, but now,
as a result following the ruin of its original owners,
it was evidently let out in flats.  The big doors,
ponderous and iron-studded, as they nearly always
are in Italy&mdash;a relic of those turbulent days when
every palazzo was a miniature fortress&mdash;were closed
when I alighted; but finding a row of bells, I
rang the one marked "terreno" (ground floor),
whereupon the door was unbolted by the occupant
of the apartment, and I immediately found myself
just inside a huge, dark hall, where the noise made
by me in stumbling over a step echoed loudly.
There is always something uncanny in the way an
Italian door is opened at night by an unseen hand,
for one naturally expects to see a person standing
behind it.  As a matter of fact, the opening is
effected by a mechanical contrivance which can be
operated at will in any of the apartments.  Thus
the occupants remain undisturbed until the visitor
arrives at their door.
</p>

<p>
I had turned, and was about to ask the cabman
to give me some wax vestas in order that I might
find my way, when a door opened at the further end
of the hall, and against the light from within I saw
the silhouette of a young Italian girl about fifteen
years old.  She came forward, looking at me
inquiringly, and then, as though she recognised my
features from a description that had been given
her, she exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"It is the Signorina Rosselli!  Pass, signorina,
pass!" and she led the way into the apartment,
closing the door behind her.  The place was
spacious, sparely furnished, but not particularly
clean.  The cheap paraffin lamp upon the table of
the small room at the back of the house to which
I was conducted was smoking, blackening the glass,
and filling the place with suffocating fumes.  The
stone floor of the apartment was without carpet,
and all the furniture it contained was a cheap
table, two or three old rush-bottomed chairs, and
a tall linen-press of a bygone day.  There was a
damp, earthy smell, which did not help to make
the place any more inviting.  Indeed, I had scarcely
set foot in it before I became seized with suspicion
and regretted that I had come.
</p>

<p>
The girl, a tall, black-eyed Livornese, who wore a
bodice of cream-coloured cotton and a stuff skirt
of dark crimson, was evidently a serving-maid, for
she drew forward one of the chairs, inviting me to
be seated.
</p>

<p>
"I presume I am expected here?" I inquired in Italian.
</p>

<p>
"Si, signorina," was the girl's reply, "the signore
will be with you in a moment.  Please be seated.
I will tell him."
</p>

<p>
She disappeared, closing the door after her.
</p>

<p>
The whole affair was mysterious.  Grim and
forbidding by day, an old Italian palazzo at night
never inspires the stranger with confidence.  Its
great chambers are full of ghosts of the past, and
one's imagination quickly conjures up visions of
those old burghers who were such good haters;
of the gay young cavaliers who rode to a joust
or a skirmish with equal nonchalance; and of
those richly-clad dames who caused all the great
tragedies that were enacted within these dark,
prison-like walls.
</p>

<p>
Little time was, however, allowed me for
reflection, for almost immediately the door opened,
and there entered a dwarfed and ugly little old
man, with a queer wizened face, deeply wrinkled,
and a grey beard, bushy and untrimmed.  His
appearance was so comical that I could scarcely
suppress a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, signorina!" he cried, in a high-pitched,
squeaky voice, "I am glad you have come.  I
feared that you might not get the letter, and the
matter is highly important."
</p>

<p>
"You are the writer of the letter?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no, signorina," the old fellow squeaked.
"Unfortunately, I cannot write&mdash;I can only make
a cross."  He spoke Italian, with a strong southern
accent, and struck me as being of the lower
class.  To me it was strange that the queer old
fellow should inhabit part of a palace of that
description.  "I did not write the letter," he went
on, "but I wished to speak with you upon an
important matter."
</p>

<p>
"I am all attention," I responded.  "Permit me
to mention that I have a cab waiting outside, and
my time is precious."
</p>

<p>
"You are anxious to return on board the yacht,
eh?" he grunted, with a strange expression upon
his puckered face.
</p>

<p>
"I must join my friends within an hour," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Your friends?" he echoed, with strange emphasis
upon the final word.  "You are best apart
from such as they."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I inquired, surprised at the old fellow's
sudden declaration.  He was evidently aware of
some fact which it was desirable that I should
know.
</p>

<p>
"There are strong reasons why the signorina
should not return on board," he declared, with a
mysterious air.
</p>

<p>
"As well as reasons why I should not number
the Signor Keppel and his guests among my
friends?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The signorina guesses right," he answered, with
a sinister smile.
</p>

<p>
"Then I presume that I may be permitted to
know those reasons?" I suggested.  "One cannot
well break off a friendship without some motive."
</p>

<p>
"Your own safety is sufficient motive, surely?"
he argued.
</p>

<p>
"I am not in fear, and as far as I am aware there
is no danger," I declared, endeavouring to show a
bold front, and hoping that the old fellow would
soon become more explicit.  He apparently alluded
to the conspiracy to blow up the yacht in order
to hide old Keppel's secret.
</p>

<p>
"But our interests are mutual," he said, glancing
at me sharply.
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"You are seeking to elucidate a mystery.  So
am I.  You are endeavouring to discover the person
who assassinated the young Signor Inglese at the
Grand Hotel at Nizza.  So am I."
</p>

<p>
"You!" I cried in surprise.  "For what reason
are you interesting yourself in the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a motive&mdash;a very strong one," he
answered.  "We ought to unite our efforts with a
view to solving the mystery."
</p>

<p>
"The police have already failed," I remarked,
inwardly ridiculing the idea that any assistance
could be rendered by the queer old fellow living
there in that dismal and silent palazzo.  Surely a
man with such a grotesque countenance could never
act the amateur detective with success!
</p>

<p>
"The police!" he sneered, when I mentioned
them.  "They are useless.  They act by rule, and
here, in Italy, may be bribed with a handful of
cigars.  The police!  They are not worth the value
of a dried fig, the whole of them."
</p>

<p>
"Then you favour independent effort, such as I
myself am making?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly," croaked the old fellow.  "It
may appear strange to you that, working in the same
direction as yourself, I am aware of all you have
already done."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," I exclaimed in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that I have been watching, just as you
have.  I know all that has happened&mdash;everything.
That is why we should combine our efforts."
</p>

<p>
"But what can you know of my inquiries?"
I exclaimed dubiously.  "We have never met
before."
</p>

<p>
"No, signorina, that is true," he laughed.  "And
we should not have met now, were it not for the fact
that events have occurred to render our meeting
necessary.  To show you that I am aware of the
efforts you have already made, I will describe to you
how the money stolen from the young Inglese was
returned to you, and then cunningly secured by
trickery.  I will tell you, too, of certain matters
which occurred in Nice, and which you, no doubt,
believe are only known to yourself."
</p>

<p>
And then he went on to describe to me events and
conversations which had taken place in Nice, in such
detail as to make it plain that the old fellow had been
well acquainted with my movements, and knew all
the efforts I had made to solve the tantalising
problem.
</p>

<p>
He spoke of Ernest, too, with a strange familiarity,
which made me believe that they had been
acquainted.  He showed himself to be intimate with
the doings of the man I loved, knowing both his past
movements and his present whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
"He is at Aix-les-Bains," he said, in reply to my
question.  "At the 'Hotel d'Europe.'"
</p>

<p>
"And she?"
</p>

<p>
"The signorina pains herself unnecessarily," the
old man responded, with a slight touch of sympathy
in his voice.  "But if she desires to know, the person
to whom she refers was, perhaps is still, at
Aix&mdash;'Hotel Lamartine.'"
</p>

<p>
"He has gone there to play, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She assists him, and has wonderful luck,
just as she had at Monte Carlo.  You remember?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I responded.  "But were you actually
there?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and from his face I knew that he also
had witnessed that woman's fortune.
</p>

<p>
"And now?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"From reports that have reached me, it seems
that her luck has not deserted her.  They made a
<i>coup</i> at baccarat three nights ago, and won eighty
thousand francs between them."
</p>

<p>
My teeth met and clenched themselves hard.  The
woman who had stolen my love held Ernest Cameron
in her toils.  He believed that her presence at the
tables brought him good fortune.  And yet I loved
him so&mdash;better than life!  The old man's words
brought to my mind a flood of recollections
belonging to the idyllic days of a love now dead.
</p>

<p>
Ah! if we had married, I would have been a much
better woman, I reflected bitterly.  To love is such
a very different thing from a desire to be beloved.
To love is woman's nature&mdash;to be beloved is the
consequence of her having properly exercised and
controlled that nature.  To love is woman's duty&mdash;to
be beloved is her reward.
</p>

<p>
But where was my reward?

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
CREATES ANOTHER PROBLEM
</h3>

<p>
The queer-looking old man sitting there before me,
fidgeting slightly in his chair, was indeed a very
grotesque figure.  From what he had said, I could
no longer doubt that he was aware of the whole of the
curious circumstances at Nice, and was likewise well
acquainted with the manner in which my relations
with Ernest had been broken off.
</p>

<p>
How he had accomplished his manifestly clever
espionage in Nice I knew not.  Certainly I had never
noticed his presence, either in Nice or in the Rooms
at Monte Carlo.  Besides, if he had presented himself
at the bureau of the Casino in such clothes as he
wore at that moment he would have been refused
admission.  A man is not allowed to enter if his
trousers are turned up in wet weather, while the
cycling tourist in knickerbockers is promptly shown
the door by the semi-military janitors.  Yet from
words he had let drop, he showed himself intimate
with all the features of the play of both Ulrica and
Ernest Cameron, and must have been present in the
crowd around the table.
</p>

<p>
The mystery surrounding the affair increased each
moment.  And now this dwarfed old man, of whose
name I was unaware, desired me to combine my
efforts with his.
</p>

<p>
With that end in view he settled to talk with me
seriously, pointing out that poor Reggie had been
murdered secretly, and that it was my duty to
discover the truth, and bring his assassin to justice.  I
admitted this, of course, but failed entirely to see
what connection the old fellow could have with it.
To me, in my ignorance of the truth, he appeared to
have entered into a matter which did not in the least
concern him.
</p>

<p>
"From what I have already told the signorina, I
think she will be convinced that our interests are
really identical," he said presently, after we had been
talking some time.  "My own inquiries have been
independent of yours, but the result has been the
same.  To put it plainly, neither of us has discovered
any clue whatsoever.  Is not that the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately so," I exclaimed.  "All my
efforts have been unavailing."
</p>

<p>
"That is the reason we must combine," he urged.
"A woman cannot hope to elucidate such a mystery
unaided.  It is impossible."
</p>

<p>
He was a crafty old fellow, this dwarfed person,
with the grotesque features.  He eyed me strangely,
and more than once I entertained misgivings that he
was not acting altogether straightforwardly.  Somehow,
his surroundings did not strike me as those of a
man who had sufficient money to travel hither and
thither in order to take up a task in which the police
had ignominiously failed.  From his rather
reluctant admissions, I gathered that he was acting at
the instigation of poor Reggie's friends; yet he was
not altogether explicit upon that point, and a good
deal of doubt existed in my mind.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said at last, in order to bring matters to
a point, "and how do you suggest that we should
combine our forces, Signor&mdash;&mdash;" and I hesitated
purposely, in order to give him an opportunity of
telling me his name.
</p>

<p>
"Branca&mdash;Francesco Branca," he exclaimed,
concluding my sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Signor Branca, I am ready to listen to any
suggestions you may make in order successfully to
trace the assassin."
</p>

<p>
"We must first understand each other perfectly,"
responded the queer old man.  "You have not yet
told me the full extent of your inquiries, or whether
you entertain any suspicion of any person.  You
have been yachting these past five weeks.  Has
nothing occurred to arouse suspicion during that
period?  If we are to combine, we must know the
extent of each other's investigations, and the result,"
he added.  "What has been the nature of your life
on board the <i>Vispera</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant, on the whole," I responded.
</p>

<p>
"Has nothing occurred?" he inquired, looking at
me with a straight and searching glance.
</p>

<p>
"You speak as though you already have knowledge
of something," I said, endeavouring to smile.
</p>

<p>
"I simply ask the question," he squeaked, in his
high-pitched voice.
</p>

<p>
At first I hesitated whether to tell him the truth;
yet when I reflected upon his statement that he was
acting in the interests of Reggie's family, I became
induced to tell the old fellow the truth regarding my
discovery in the deck-house, and the plot I had overheard.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to my expectations, my statement did
not disturb him in the least.  He only raised his grey
brows with an expression of surprise, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Then I was correct in my surmise that certain
persons on board the yacht are not your friends,
signorina.  Was I not?"
</p>

<p>
"You were," I admitted.  "But it is Mr. Keppel
himself who will be responsible for the blowing up of
the vessel, because he has acquiesced in a suggestion
made by a person unknown."
</p>

<p>
"You never saw the man who was speaking with
this Mr. Keppel?  You are certain of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  He was very careful not to come within
range of the open ventilator."
</p>

<p>
"A wary person, evidently," grunted the old
fellow.  "Depend upon it, he has some very strong
motive for the vessel being sent to the bottom with
all on board.  The captain suspects nothing, I take
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely nothing.  Ought we to warn him?"
</p>

<p>
"Warn him!" cried the old man.  "Why, certainly
not.  We must remain quite quiet, and be
extremely careful not to show our hand.  Their
secret is ours.  For us that is sufficient at the present
juncture," he added, with an air of contentment.
</p>

<p>
"But delay may result in the catastrophe," I
said.  "The yacht may sail at any moment when
it pleases her owner to cast her away."
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, after a few moments of hesitation,
"what you have told me certainly increases
the mystery, and is deeply interesting.  You have,
I suppose, no suspicion that any of the yacht's
officers are aware of the plot?"
</p>

<p>
"The unseen originator of the conspiracy may
have been an officer, for aught I know," I said.  "I
have related the occurrence to you just as it took
place.  I know exactly nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"But you must discover more," he declared
anxiously.  "The matter must not rest here.  If what
you say is really true, then there has been murder
done on board.  The mysterious passenger is a
perplexing feature, to say the least.  Describe her to
me as fully as you can."
</p>

<p>
I acted upon his suggestion.  Unfortunately,
however, suspended as I had been in that tearing
wind on the night of my discovery, I had been unable
to take in every detail of her features.  But I gave
him a description as minute as was possible, and it
apparently satisfied him.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," he murmured, "very strange!  To
me it seems as though your discovery leads us into
an entirely different channel of inquiry.  Surely
Keppel himself had nothing to do with the assassination
of young Signor Thorne!" he added slowly, as
though the startling theory only that moment
occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
More than once already had that same suspicion
crossed my mind, but I had always laughed it to
scorn.  There was an utter absence of motive, that
convinced me of its impossibility.
</p>

<p>
And yet, had I not actually heard with my own
ears Keppel confess to a murder which he himself had
committed?
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that the lady could have come on
board at Algiers?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell," was my answer.  "The deckhouse
has been kept closed and curtained during the
whole cruise.  It was that fact which aroused my
feminine curiosity."
</p>

<p>
"If the fact caused you to investigate, it may also
have induced others to make inquiry," he remarked.
"Do you think it has?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I tell?  One fact is certain, namely,
that I am the only person who was a witness of the
crime, or who overheard the unseen man's suggestion."
</p>

<p>
"You would be unable to recognise the voice of
that person?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I responded.  "In that wild hurricane
it was difficult to distinguish the tone of
voice."
</p>

<p>
He remained thoughtfully silent for a long time.
The muscles of his grotesque face worked strangely,
and in his eyes was a crafty look which somehow gave
me the impression that he was aware of more than
he had told me.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he exclaimed at last, shifting his position
slightly and looking me straight in the face, "and
what is your present suggestion?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems very plain that if the yacht sails she
is doomed, with all on board," I said, "therefore,
she must not leave Leghorn."
</p>

<p>
"I quite grant that," responded my companion;
"but how can you prevent it?  Her owner is a
person of many eccentricities.  This morning he says
he will remain here a week, yet to-night, when you
are all calmly asleep, he may order his captain to put
to sea.  Who is to prevent him?  Neither you nor
myself."
</p>

<p>
"My intention is to keep a strict watch upon his
movements, and ascertain where he goes, and
whether any explosive is taken on board," I said.
</p>

<p>
"A most laudable intention, but I fear it is one
that you will find very difficult to execute," he said.
"If I may be permitted to advise, you should leave
that matter to me, and turn your attention rather
to the locked deck-house.  By some means you must
gain an entry, and see what is really concealed
there."
</p>

<p>
"I am well aware of what secret is hidden there,
without gaining an entrance," I responded.
</p>

<p>
"You tell me that the woman is dead," he
observed.  "Well, I do not doubt you; but I nevertheless
consider it strange that if she is dead, and the
persons concerned in her decease wished to get rid of
the body, they have not already dropped it overboard.
Such a matter would not be at all difficult
in the night.  Why would Keppel, a parsimonious
man, consent to the total destruction of a yacht of
the costly character of the <i>Vispera</i>?  It is utterly
unreasonable."
</p>

<p>
"From one point of view I quite agree with you,"
I argued; "but there may be further reasons why
the yacht should be cast away&mdash;reasons of which
we are ignorant."
</p>

<p>
"But is it reasonable that the owner of a yacht
would enter the port of Leghorn with a body on
board?" he queried.  "No.  The officials are too
prying.  Depend upon it, the body is no longer on
board.  They've got rid of the evidence of the
crime&mdash;Keppel and this unknown accomplice of his."
</p>

<p>
"Then if such is the truth, why should they plot
to cast the vessel away?"
</p>

<p>
"That is exactly my argument.  I am convinced
that although the question of blowing up the <i>Vispera</i>
may have been mooted, the project has now been
abandoned.  At first it appeared to me more likely
that Keppel and his associate would place some
explosive on board and make an excuse for not sailing
in the vessel.  But on reflection it seems obvious
that the body cannot now be on board, and
therefore no end would be gained by casting the ship
away.  No, there is no danger in returning on
board&mdash;none whatever.  True, Keppel is very eccentric,
like many man of great wealth, and may sail again
at any moment; but it is equally certain that the
dastardly project is not to be put into execution."
</p>

<p>
"Then you believe that all is quite safe on board?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite convinced of it.  Your best plan of
action, if you agree to combine your efforts with my
own, is to return and use every means to gain an
entrance to the deck-house.  I have not the slightest
expectation that you will discover any actual trace
of the crime, but I somehow feel confident that what
it contains will give us some clue."
</p>

<p>
"A clue to the mystery in Nice?" I inquired eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he responded, not without some hesitation.
"I believe that we shall gain knowledge
from that carefully-guarded cabin."
</p>

<p>
"But it is always locked," I protested, "and
Keppel keeps the key upon his chain."
</p>

<p>
"You must exercise your woman's ingenuity,"
he laughed.  "Already you have proved yourself
to be as keen and resourceful as any professional
detector of crime.  Continue, and we shall
succeed."
</p>

<p>
"If, as you appear to anticipate, we sail to-night,
we may not meet again," I remarked.  "Shall I
address you here in case of necessity?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Do not write to me.  We know not into
whose hands the letter might fall," he answered
quickly.  "We shall meet again, signorina, never
fear&mdash;in Leghorn, or in some other city.  I shall
travel by land, you by sea."
</p>

<p>
"But what causes you to anticipate that the
<i>Vispera</i> will leave to-night?" I demanded, for he
spoke with such authority that I was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"I read certain telegrams which Keppel sent
off to-day.  I followed him to the telegraph-office,
and watched him write.  He probably believed
that I could not read English.  From the messages,
it appeared that the <i>Vispera</i> is to go direct from
here to Ragusa, in the Adriatic, and thence to
Venice."
</p>

<p>
"Then we are turning back again!" I cried in
dismay.  "It was understood that we were on our
way to Marseilles, where the party was to break up."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, but the <i>Vispera's</i> itinerary appears to
have now been altered by its eccentric owner, and
as soon as possible you will leave for the Adriatic."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said frankly, "to tell the truth, I
have no desire to go on board again."
</p>

<p>
"But it is imperative," the old fellow declared
quickly; "absolutely imperative!  You must not
drop your inquiries at this the most critical moment.
You must find means to enter that deck-house.
Spare no pains, and use every endeavour and every
wile to gain your end.  We must know what is
hidden there."
</p>

<p>
"Shall you go to Venice and meet me there?"
I inquired anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I cannot tell!  So much depends upon the
inquiries I am making, and upon future occurrences.
But we shall meet soon, never fear!"
</p>

<p>
Certainly it was curious to find in that Italian
port, into which, as far as I could gather, we had
put on mere chance, a man who had the whole
mystery at his fingers' ends, and who, like myself,
was sparing no pains to elucidate it.  But had we
put into Leghorn by mere chance; or had it all
been cunningly prearranged?
</p>

<p>
"Then I am not to write to you?" I said, somewhat
dissatisfied.
</p>

<p>
"No, decidedly not," was his response.  "We
must in this affair exercise every precaution in
order to make certain that our intentions are not
discovered by the guilty parties.  Return on board,
remain ever watchful, allow nothing to escape you,
and make Keppel himself your especial study, at
the same time seeking for means by which to enter
the forbidden deck-house."
</p>

<p>
"I take it, Signor Branca, that this apartment
is not your own?" I said, as I glanced round the
place.
</p>

<p>
"Mine!" he laughed.  "Oh, dear no!  I am
only here temporarily, in order to meet you.  In
an hour I leave here&mdash;whither I know not.  I
was in Rome last night, I am here to-night;
to-morrow night I may be in Milan, or Turin, or
Nice&mdash;who knows?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke in French for the first time, and I saw
by his excellent accent that, so far from my first
estimate of him being correct, he was a thorough
cosmopolitan.  It seemed a pity that his personal
appearance was sufficiently ugly to be remarkable.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the watch in my bangle and saw that
as it was already past eleven o'clock, it was high
time for me to return on board.  Therefore I rose
to bid my strange host "<i>Addio</i>."
</p>

<p>
He bowed to me with a courtly grace which
rendered his dwarfed figure more than usually
grotesque, bending so low that his fringe of grey
beard almost touched his knees.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Addio</i>, signorina," he said.  "Do not relax
your efforts for a single moment.  Accompany the
<i>Vispera</i> on the remainder of its cruise, and seek
to obtain all the knowledge you can.  For my part,
I shall do my best; and I have much to do&mdash;very
much, I assure you.  But I am confident that
before we meet again we shall both have obtained
a clue to the mysterious death of the young Signor
Thorne."
</p>

<p>
"One moment," I said, after some hesitation,
for I was reluctant to approach a subject which
preyed ever upon my mind.  "Answer me truthfully.
Do you entertain suspicion that Mr. Thorne's
assassin was the man who once loved me&mdash;Ernest
Cameron?"
</p>

<p>
He regarded me in profound surprise.
</p>

<p>
"No," he responded promptly.  "I am convinced
of the contrary.  There could have been no
motive, and besides&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused, not finishing the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Besides, the inquiries I made in Nice and Monte
Carlo gave a result identical with those made by the
police, namely, that Signor Cameron was innocent."
</p>

<p>
"If you have no suspicion of him, then I am
content," I declared, breathing more freely.
</p>

<p>
My dwarfish companion smiled knowingly, for he
was aware that I still loved the man who had
abandoned me.  Yet there was a strange look in
his keen dark eyes that I had not before noticed.
As I drove back through the silent streets of the
Italian city, down to the port, his sinister countenance,
with its indescribable expression of craftiness,
haunted me incessantly.  Why that final glance of
his had produced such an impression upon me I was,
even after many hours spent in wonderment, utterly
at a loss to explain.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
A MILLIONAIRE'S MANOEUVRES
</h3>

<p>
Will you, my reader, forgive me if for a few
moments I am prosy?  I speak only of what is so very
near my woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
When we think of what Society might be to us,
it becomes a painful thing to speak of what it is.
When we, who are world-weary, think of the seasons
of mental refreshment which might be enjoyed, the
possible interchange of mutual trust and kindness,
the awakening of new ideas, the correction of old
ones, the sweeping away of prejudice and the
establishment of thought, the extension of benevolence
and the increase of sympathy, confidence, and
good faith which might thus be brought about
amongst the families of mankind, we become filled
only by regret that the young and the joyous spirit,
buoyant with the energies of untried life and warm
with the generous flow of unchecked feeling, must
so soon become disillusioned.
</p>

<p>
You, my reader, know too well how soon we all
tire of the eternal shams which go to make up our
present social life.  You yourself are weary of it,
though perhaps you hesitate to confess this openly,
because such a confession would be an offence
against the <i>convenances</i>.  <i>Convenances!</i>  Bah!
Society as it now exists is such that no mother,
once she has launched her daughter into its
maelstrom by that process known as "coming out,"
ever hopes to receive back to the peaceful nest
the wing so lately fledged, unruffled by its flight,
the snowy breast unstained, or the beating heart
as true as when it first went forth elated by the
glowing hope of finding in Society what it never
yet was rich enough to yield.
</p>

<p>
And yet the charge we women bring against
Society for its flattery and its falsehood is an
old-established one, and we go on year after year
complaining in the same strain; those who have
expected most, and have been the most deceived,
complaining in the bitterest terms.
</p>

<p>
Having run the whole gamut of Society's follies,
I had become heartsick; and never was the bald
truth more forcibly impressed upon me than that
night when, on descending to my cabin on board the
<i>Vispera</i>, I found Ulrica there&mdash;the gay, careless
Ulrica, whose <i>sang-froid</i> nothing ever
ruffled&mdash;examining one of my newest gowns.  She was an
average woman, one of ten thousand or more to be
found any day during the season between Hyde
Park Corner and Kensington Church, gay and
chic, with just that slight touch of the cosmopolitan
which always proves so attractive to men.  It is
women such as she whose sentiments and feelings
give tone to Society, and Society&mdash;which now apes
the tone, the manners, and the dress of the modern
Aspasia&mdash;influences the sentiments and feelings of
English life.
</p>

<p>
"Why, how horribly late you are, dear!" Ulrica
began, when I entered my cabin.  "We've all been
thinking that you were lost, or else that the Countess
had induced you to remain with her.  Gerald has
taken a cab back to Ardenza to look for you."
</p>

<p>
This announcement caused me considerable
annoyance, but I affected to pass it by, laughingly
remarking that I had stayed late with my old
schoolfellow.
</p>

<p>
"These Italian ports are always cut-throat
places, Gerald said; and when you were not back at
half-past ten, he decided to go and look for you."
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of him," I remarked.  "You all
dined on board, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Mr. Keppel decided upon dining ashore,
so we went to a thoroughly Italian hotel&mdash;the
'Giappone,' I believe it was called.  It was quite
a plain, unpretending place, but the food was really
extraordinary.  I've never had better cooking,
even at the 'Carlton.'"
</p>

<p>
"I know it well," I said.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, everyone who knows Leghorn knows the
"Giappone."  As the "Star and Garter" is to
Richmond, so is the "Giappone" to Leghorn.
Only the "Giappone," clean, plain and
comfortable, has never assumed the designation of
"hotel," but still rejoices in the fact that it is merely
an <i>albergo</i>, or inn.  Of recent years throughout the
Italy of the tourist there have sprung up great
glaring caravanseries, where the cooking is a bad
imitation of the French style, where the Italian
waiters are bound to speak French, and the name
of the hostelry is French (the "o" in hotel always
bearing a circumflex), and where the accommodation
is third-rate, at exorbitant prices.  It is, therefore,
refreshing to find an <i>albergo</i> like the "Giappone,"
where not a soul speaks either English or French,
which still retains its old-fashioned character, and
is noted throughout the whole kingdom for its
marvellous cooking and absurdly low charges.  It
is perhaps fortunate that the Cookite has never
discovered that long, white-painted <i>salle-à-manger</i>
where, upon each small table, stands the great
flask of Tuscan wine, and where one can dine as a
millionaire for the Italian equivalent of two shillings.
Some day the place will be "discovered," but
happy those who know it now, before its homelike
character is swept away.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mr. Keppel?" I inquired, anxious to
know whether he had come on board.
</p>

<p>
"In the smoking saloon.  There has been music,
and I left him chatting with Lord Stoneborough
ten minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
"What are our future movements?  Have you heard?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  I forgot to tell you.  At dinner
to-night old Mr. Keppel announced that we should
remain here another couple of days or so, and
then go up the Adriatic to Ragusa, and later
proceed to Venice.  We're to land there, instead of at
Marseilles."
</p>

<p>
Her reply surprised me, for it showed that the
queer old man I had visited had actually spoken
the truth and was apparently well up in all the
millionaire's intentions.
</p>

<p>
"Why have the plans been changed?" I
inquired, as I drew off my gloves.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, because several of the people wanted to go
up to Switzerland, I believe, and have induced old
Keppel to land them at Venice, instead of in the
South of France.  The Viscera is to lay up at
Fiume, it seems."
</p>

<p>
"But only yesterday he told me that he intended
to sail home in her to Portsmouth," I said.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, the old fellow is as full of plans as he
is of sovereigns, and is a most vague person regarding
his future movements.  Somehow, I can't tell in
what manner, to me he seems to have changed
wonderfully during the past few days."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" I asked quickly.  It was
strange that she should have detected a difference
in his manner.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I sat next to him at dinner to-night,
and couldn't help noticing how nervous and queer
he seemed.  Perhaps it's one of those penalties
of wealth which people are so fond of telling us
about.  If I had wealth I wouldn't heed the
so-called penalties, would you, dear?  The possession
of only another five hundred a year would make
me one of the happiest women in the world."
</p>

<p>
"That's the universal cry," I laughed.  "Why
aren't you more original, Ulrica?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it's such bad form to be original
nowadays, when everything has been said before.
There is no further smartness in conversation.  A
woman can only shine by the aid of Paquin, or some
other Vendome artist."
</p>

<p>
And so she chattered on merrily, until at length
her eye caught my little travelling clock, when
she saw that it was already an hour past midnight.
The tramping of men on deck had ceased, and all
had grown quiet, save for a low pumping sound from
the engine-room.
</p>

<p>
"Well, dear," she said, "I suppose it's time to
turn in.  We all go over to Pisa to-morrow to see
the sights&mdash;Leaning Tower, Cathedral, and that
sort of thing.  I've seen them all before, and so
have you."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  When a child, I had stood beneath the
campanile, marvelling at what Suor Angelica used
to say was one of the seven wonders of the world;
had knelt in reverence in the Duomo, and wandered
in amazement through the old marble-built
Campo Santo&mdash;how many years ago, I did not care
to reflect.
</p>

<p>
"You will go with them?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"We must both go, much as it bores us.  For
myself, I hate sight-seeing at any time, and more
especially the re-visitation of things one has seen
in one's early youth.  Yachting is delightful, and
I love it.  But the enthusiasm of one's friends when
they get ashore is always apt to become tiresome.
No, my dear Carmela, we're in for a day of
self-sacrifice to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  For myself, I would have preferred
to remain in Leghorn, for to me Pisa always seems
like a marble-built city of the dead.  A single
visit there in the course of a life-time is sufficient
for most people, and the modern tourist, <i>en route</i>
for Rome, generally "does" the sights in a couple
of hours, and is glad to get away to the Eternal
City.  For the archæologist there is much of
interest, but we women of the world are neither
dry-as-dust professors nor ten-days-in-Italy tourists,
and care nothing for the treasuries of its Archivio
di Stato, the traditions connected with the
miracle-working and carefully-veiled "Madonna sotto gli
Organi," the tattered banners of the Knights of
St. Stephen, or why the Messa dei Cacciatori was
instituted.  To me, as to most people who have
once set foot in Pisa, its mediæval glories are
mouldy.
</p>

<p>
When Ulrica had left me, I stood before the small
mirror of my tiny, white-enamelled cabin, gazing
blankly at my own reflection.  Why had Ernest
forsaken me in favour of that tow-haired, doll-like
person, whose parentage no one knew, and whose
manners, as far as I had been able to observe them,
savoured more of Kennington than Kensington?
I was good-looking, still young, still attractive,
still sufficiently alluring to cause men to turn and
glance after me.  That candid friend, my mirror,
told me so each time I sought its opinion.  And yet
I who loved him with all my soul was abandoned!
</p>

<p>
The queer old man's injunctions recurred to me.
It was necessary that I should investigate what was
contained in that locked deck-house over my head.
But how?
</p>

<p>
Gerald had told us that the place contained
curiosities purchased in Tangier, an explanation
evidently given by his father.  That this was not
the truth I was already aware.  Yet if the body
of the mysterious female passenger was still there,
it was remarkable that the Customs officers had not
found it.  Still, the men of the Italian dogana are
easily bribed.  They get half the fines imposed
upon contraband, a fact which makes them very
eager to discover dutiable articles&mdash;and nearly
everything is liable to taxation in Italy&mdash;but a sly
douceur is to them always preferable to the labour
entailed in searching a ship and finding nothing to
reward them.  Davis, the bluff, red-faced captain,
or one of his officers, being well aware of this, might,
for aught I knew, have judiciously dispensed a few
paper <i>lire</i>.
</p>

<p>
Though old Branca had given his opinion that
there was no longer any danger of the dastardly
plot being carried into effect, I was not at all
convinced of the safety of the vessel.  Thus, without
removing my hat, I sat on the edge of my narrow
little berth for a long time, thinking.  We were to
sail for the Adriatic.  That in itself was suspicious;
for why should we retrace our course down the
Italian coast again, when the intention had been to
make for Marseilles?  Keppel had some strong and
secret motive for so suddenly altering our plans.
</p>

<p>
The pumping in the engine-room had been
succeeded by the low whirr of the dynamo.  At that
hour all on board were asleep; for lying as we were
off the Mole, there was no necessity for a
night-watch to be kept; therefore I decided to venture
back on deck, ostensibly to take the air and admire
the clearness of the magnificent Italian night, but
really to take observations of the locked deck-house.
</p>

<p>
Stealthily, on tiptoe, I crept out of my cabin, and
up the stairs on to the deck.  The night was
brilliant&mdash;one of those which the dweller on the
Mediterranean shore knows so well in spring, calm, balmy,
starlit, with the crescent moon shedding its light
over the distant range of mountains far inland.  The
lights of the harbour were reflected by the dark,
unsteady waters; and from the ancient lighthouse
shone the bright rays of warning far across old
Neptune's highway.
</p>

<p>
As I emerged on deck, before me extended the
long line of electric lamps along the Passeggio to
Ardenza, and behind me lay the brightly-lit City
of Leghorn, complex and mysterious.  From across
the port came the sound of steam winches,
interspersed now and then with the low rumbling of coal
being shot into barges&mdash;the produce of Cardiff and
Newcastle, disembarked by some "tramp" eager
for departure; and once there came from over the
water the hoarse note of a steam siren announcing a
vessel's immediate sailing.
</p>

<p>
I lingered for a moment, affecting to enjoy the
night air, but really to disarm the suspicion of
anyone who might be astir.  All on board was quiet,
however, and the silence reassured me.  I crept
forward to the deck-house, passing its closed and
curtained port-holes.
</p>

<p>
My heart leaped quickly.  There was a light
within.
</p>

<p>
As I slowly picked my way past I distinctly
heard a voice, but could not recognise it.  The
sound, however, made it apparent that two persons
were within.  Carefully I walked around, but found
all three port-holes heavily curtained.  At one I
listened, but could distinguish nothing.  It was a
man's voice; that was all I could tell.
</p>

<p>
I bethought myself of the ventilator by which I
had before been enabled to overhear the conversation
within, and wondered whether it was open.
Without hesitation I swung myself up to the top
of the deck-cabin, but was dismayed to find the
small aperture tightly closed.  I listened, but only
heard a voice speaking in a gruff tone.  As to what
words were said I could obtain no idea.  The voice
sounded like that of old Mr. Keppel, but even of
this I was not altogether certain.
</p>

<p>
Were the occupants of that locked cabin engaged
in perfecting the plot to destroy the <i>Vispera</i>?  To
me it seemed very much as if they were.  I slid down
from my position, which was rather insecure for a
woman, and concealed myself in the dark and
narrow gangway between the deck-house and the
covering of a hatchway, in order to watch the exit.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
WHEREIN CAPTAIN DAVIS SPEAKS HIS MIND
</h3>

<p>
I suppose I must have crouched there for a full
half-hour.  When one is watching eagerly, however,
time always appears longer.
</p>

<p>
The steamer whose siren had awakened the echoes
of the port had swung from her moorings, and slowly
glided past us to the open sea, making a southward
course; while work on the collier appeared to be
finished, and the whole port had settled down to the
peace of night.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I heard the voices within raised, as if
in altercation.  I rose at once, and placed my ear
to the glass of the curtained port-hole.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you it's a lie&mdash;a confounded lie!" I heard
a man's voice exclaim.  "You can have no basis
for any such allegation."
</p>

<p>
"I only state plainly what I think," responded
the other.  "All the facts tend to show that such
was the case."
</p>

<p>
The other man laughed a dry, cynical laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And what do your guests think of this sudden
change of plans?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Think!" responded Keppel, for one voice I now
recognised as his.  "They are happy enough.
The Adriatic is always more attractive for yachting
than the Mediterranean."
</p>

<p>
"Well," responded his companion, "act just as
you think fit.  I shall not advise."
</p>

<p>
"It is not for you to advise," answered the owner
of the <i>Vispera</i> sharply.  "You are my servant, and
therefore must do my bidding."
</p>

<p>
"You asked my advice, sir, ten minutes ago,
otherwise I should not have presumed to speak as
I have just spoken."
</p>

<p>
"You are a great deal too presumptuous on board
the <i>Vispera</i>, Davis," Keppel snapped.  "Please
recollect that when I am here I am master."
</p>

<p>
His words proved that the man with whom he
was speaking was the captain.
</p>

<p>
"I regret if you've taken any word or action of
mine as presumptuous, sir," responded the skipper
gruffly.  "I'm a seafaring man, sir, and ain't much
used to polite society."
</p>

<p>
"When I give my orders I expect them to be
obeyed without question, Captain Davis."
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready to obey what orders you give, sir.
I'll take the <i>Vispera</i> to any point of the compass
you like.  You pay me £28 10s. a month, and I'm
yours to command."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Davis.  Then listen," I heard Keppel
say, although he lowered his voice somewhat.  "My
instructions to you are entirely confidential, you
understand.  To-morrow I shall send on board a
small case.  It will be rather heavy, for it contains a
piece of marble statuary from Pisa.  You'll receive
it by the last train, at about midnight, and when
you've got it aboard you'll sail at once for Ragusa."
</p>

<p>
"Without the guests?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  You will take them with you," was Keppel's
response.  "Mr. Gerald is going to Florence in
the morning, so he will be absent.  So shall I."
</p>

<p>
"You will join us later, I suppose, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Perhaps at Venice.  But you'll receive
telegraphic orders from me at Ragusa."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm not to sail before I receive the case?"
observed the captain.
</p>

<p>
"No.  It will arrive by the last train, and will
be addressed to you.  Send someone to the station
for it, and put it in a safe place in the hold.  It is a
valuable statuette that has been bought for me.  So
mind it doesn't get damaged."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," responded the captain, "I can't
answer for those Italian railways; but you can be
sure I'll take good care of it here."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Recollect what I have told you is
entirely confidential.  The party is due at Pisa
to-morrow, but will return to dine on board.  I have a
lot of business to attend to on shore, so possibly I
may not return with them.  If I don't sail with you,
don't be surprised."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand, sir," replied the captain.
"I shall keep my own counsel, and sail as soon as
I get the box.  Had I better call at Naples if you
don't sail with us?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  If I cannot come, put into Palermo.  I'll
wire you there."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir," was the response.
</p>

<p>
Davis, a trustworthy old Mediterranean skipper,
who knew the rugged Italian coast as well as he
did the Thames Embankment, and who had spent
half a lifetime on colliers and tramps between
Gibraltar and the Greek Islands, was a short, stout,
round-faced man who wore a very thick pea-jacket
even in the warmest weather, and who was always
speaking of his "missus an' the kids," kept snug
by him at Barking.
</p>

<p>
I had often had chats with him, for he had
initiated me into the mysteries of taking sights, and
had given me many a lesson in nautical affairs.  He
was full of droll stories, and had more than once
delighted us by relating his humorous experiences
while cycling ashore in company with the engineer,
whom he always referred to as his "chief."  He was
fond of potent drinks, and sometimes was heard
using strong language to the men, in the usual
manner of Mediterranean skippers; but he was,
nevertheless, a safe man, and had commanded
several passenger boats of a well-known line.
</p>

<p>
I discovered that the particular port-hole at which
I was listening was not screwed down tightly, and
therefore I could distinguish the voices.
</p>

<p>
"Recollect," his master went on, "you are not
to wait for me.  To-morrow evening at dinner you
must give the guests to understand that you have
received immediate orders to sail, otherwise they
may go off to the theatre or somewhere, and you'll
experience a difficulty in re-collecting them.  Then
send for the box, and get away as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't wait a minute for you, sir, depend upon
it.  Let me get that box, and the <i>Vispera</i> will soon
be steaming past Gorgona."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't want the guests to think this has
been arranged between you and me, recollect.  They
may consider it rather a slight for neither myself nor
my son to be on board.  But you must explain
next day how business pressed upon me at the last
moment, and prevented me from sailing.  Tell
them I'll join the yacht at Palermo.  In fact," he
added, "tell them any lies you like.  I know you're
a glorious liar!"
</p>

<p>
The skipper laughed.
</p>

<p>
"A captain's first duty, sir, is to know how to
lie to consuls and Customs officers.  The Board o'
Trade ought to examine him in this art before
granting him his certificate.  A skipper who can't
lie&mdash;and especially here in the Mediterranean&mdash;ain't
worth the smell of an oil-rag.  He's more
bother to his owners than he's worth."
</p>

<p>
"Well, just exercise your untruthful proclivities
upon my guests on this occasion, Davis, and I shall
not forget to find something handsome for you at
the end of this cruise.  Up to the present I have had
no cause whatever to complain."
</p>

<p>
"Glad to hear that, sir.  Very glad, indeed,"
responded the old navigator.  "To handle a boat
like the <i>Vispera</i> is different to handling a coal barge
from Cardiff, for instance.  Aboard of the latter you
can get work out of your men by swearin' at them,
and even out o' the boilers by just calling them a
few names what ain't polite.  But on board of this
here yacht I'm always afraid of openin' my mouth,
and that's the truth.  With ladies about you have
to be so awful careful.  I know," he added, "that I
could have made much better time if I might only
have given my tongue a bit o' liberty."
</p>

<p>
"Give it liberty in your own cabin, Davis,"
laughed the millionaire.  "The ladies are not used
to nautical epithets."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  Not this cruise," was the other's
response.  "I'm storing of 'em up to be used on
the trip home, when we're without passengers.
The atmosphere'll turn blue round and over this
yacht then, I can promise you."
</p>

<p>
His master laughed again, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  As long as you perfectly understand
my instructions, that is sufficient.  Put into
Palermo, and if you receive no telegram there, go
on at once to Ragusa.  Remember to make it plain
to the guests that I'm very busy, and that I shall
rejoin you in Sicily."
</p>

<p>
"Never fear, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And recollect the box," was Keppel's injunction.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send two men who speak Italian up to the
railway station to meet the last train.  Will it
be too heavy to be brought down to the port on a
cab?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  It is quite small&mdash;merely a statuette,"
the millionaire explained.  "See that it is stored in a
dry place.  Somewhere near the engine-room would
be best."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see to that, sir.  Any other orders?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only be very careful that when you put
into Palermo those confounded Customs officers
don't break open the case.  They may injure its
contents.  Best put it into a cabin and let them
seal up the door, as they do the wines."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir.  They're uncommon handy with
their lead seals down at Palermo.  I'll have it
placed along with the wines, then it'll be as safe as in
the bank."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Barnes is still at the Villa Fabron, so if you
want to make any communication, and don't know
my whereabouts, wire to him," Keppel said.  "Just
at present my movements are somewhat uncertain."
</p>

<p>
"I'll remember that, sir," replied the captain.
I heard a movement as though he had risen to go
back to his berth.  "But I'd like to mention one
thing, if I may, sir.  Do you know, I was quite
surprised to find you in here to-night.  This place
has been locked up during the whole cruise, and
the reason of it has been a mystery to both the crew
and the passengers.  The men are very superstitious,
and more than once declared that something
uncanny was hidden here."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense!" cried the owner of the yacht.
"You see what is in here.  Only some of that
Moorish furniture which I bought at Tangier on
the voyage out."
</p>

<p>
"But the men have declared to me that they've
seen lights within, and heard strange noises," said
the bluff skipper dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"They'll say the <i>Vispera</i> is haunted next,"
the other laughed.  "Well," he added, "you can
see for yourself that there's nothing supernatural
here.  You sailors see omens in everything, Davis."
</p>

<p>
"I'm no believer in ghosts, or anything of that
kind myself," was the response; "but one night,
when we were off Pantalleria, I was on the bridge,
and saw with my own eyes lights shining through
these curtains.  I'll swear it!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I had gone there myself for some
purpose," Keppel explained rather lamely.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think that, sir, for you were asleep
in your own cabin."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I alone have the key, so no one else could
have entered."
</p>

<p>
"That's just my argument," the captain declared.
"There's something uncanny about this deck-house,
but what it is I can't quite make out.  The
look-out man one night swore that he heard a scream
coming from it, and I had the devil's own job to
persuade him to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
"That look-out man had had his grog, I suppose,
and mistook the whistling of the wind in the rigging,"
responded the old millionaire, with an air of
nonchalance.  "All such superstitious fears are rubbish."
</p>

<p>
"To the landsman, yes, but not to the sailor,
sir," was the skipper's response.  "When we see
a light in the port-hole of an empty cabin, we
know one thing is quite certain," he said gravely.
</p>

<p>
"And what's that?"
</p>

<p>
"That the ship will go down before very long."
</p>

<p>
"That's cheerful," remarked the owner of the
<i>Vispera</i>.  "And when do you and your crew
expect that interesting event to occur, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, of course we can't tell.  Only I,
myself, would like to get back to Barking once
again before the <i>Vispera</i> goes away from under me."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a fool, Davis?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope not, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems to me that such superstitions
don't suit a hard, practical man like yourself.
You've held a master's certificate for the past
twenty years or more, and surely by this time you
aren't upset or unnerved by the gossip of the
forecastle?"
</p>

<p>
"Not usually, Mr. Keppel.  But in this case I
confess I am a bit dubious.  I saw the mysterious
light myself."
</p>

<p>
"I might have gone there for some purpose or
other, and forgot to switch off the light."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it disappeared during the time I
watched it," was the response.  "To make sure
that you were not there I sent a man down to your
cabin, and he found you asleep there.  So you
couldn't have been in here."
</p>

<p>
"Electric lights have queer vagaries," the owner
of the vessel remarked.  "Perhaps the continual
vibration of the engines injured the lamp, and
extinguished it just at that moment.  That's not at all
an uncommon circumstance, as you know well."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir!"  I heard Davis say in a tone of
conviction; "there was either somebody in here, or
else something uncanny.  Of that I'm quite
certain."
</p>

<p>
"Stowaways don't usually luxuriate in electric
lights," laughed Keppel.  "No, Davis, without
doubt there is some quite simple explanation of
what you believe to be a phenomenon.  Think
no more about it.  Leave omens and all such
things to these superstitious Italians."
</p>

<p>
The captain gave vent to a low grunt of
dissatisfaction, which marked a habit of his.  He
was a hale and merry fellow, but from what he had
said, it was evident he entertained a strong
suspicion that he had carried a mysterious passenger.
That all traces of the crime had been removed was
plain, otherwise old Mr. Keppel would not have
invited his captain to talk with him there.  Of
course he had done this in order to convince Davis
that nothing was amiss.  Indeed, the millionaire's
coolness surprised me, for it was remarkable.  Yet
it showed plainly one fact, namely, that by some
means or other the body of the unfortunate
passenger had been got rid of, just as old Branca had
declared.
</p>

<p>
Our host now intended to send on board a box
said to contain a statuette, and at the same time,
accompanied by his son, to desert his guests and
leave the vessel to its fate.
</p>

<p>
To me there was but one theory: that box
he had spoken of would contain the explosive
which was destined to send the <i>Vispera</i> to the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
But what was the motive if, as seemed so probable,
all evidence of the crime had been completely
effaced?

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
IS ASTONISHING
</h3>

<p>
We have an ancient proverb in Tuscany which
says, "<i>Rimediare al male fin dal suo principio</i>."  This
very excellent maxim I was endeavouring to
carry out.  But it is always difficult&mdash;extremely
difficult, especially for a woman.
</p>

<p>
When I had at length crept back to my cabin,
fearing discovery by one or other of the pair whose
interesting conversation I had overheard, I bolted
my door and gave myself up to reflection.  To
act was imperative.  The mysterious old man in
the Via Magenta, who seemed so well informed as
to Keppel's movements, and who had even told me
the whereabouts of Ernest, was wrong in his
surmise that the dastardly plot to blow up the yacht
had been abandoned.  The vessel was to sail to her
doom.  I alone knew the truth, and upon me
devolved the duty of saving the lives of all on
board.
</p>

<p>
If I failed, then the millionaire's yacht would be
added to that long list of vessels which have sailed
merrily from port, never to be seen or heard of
afterwards.  How many of these have been wilfully
blown up for the sake of insurance money or of
private vengeance is a question bitter to
contemplate, and hard to answer.  Certain it is that
the elements are not responsible for all the vessels
posted at Lloyd's as "missing" during recent
years.
</p>

<p>
Slowly I undressed and entered my berth, but
was unable to sleep, so full was my mind of grave
thoughts.  For a full half-hour I heard tramping
in the deck-cabin above me; then all grew silent,
and at last I dozed.
</p>

<p>
The dressing-bell awakened me in the morning,
and after I had dressed I went along to Ulrica's
cabin, where she was preparing herself with an ill
grace to accompany the party to Pisa.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully tired of this trip!" I exclaimed,
seating myself wearily upon the edge of the berth,
"Five weeks at sea is quite sufficient for all
purposes, without being taken around the Adriatic
merely on account of old Keppel's whim."
</p>

<p>
"So am I terribly tired of it, my dear," Ulrica
declared.  "I only wish I could make some excuse
to stay ashore."
</p>

<p>
That was exactly what I desired.  I had no
intention of sailing again in the doomed vessel,
and had determined that she should not.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't we both stay ashore?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't," she responded, "for one simple
reason.  Gerald is leaving for Florence this morning;
and if it were found that I, too, were missing, evil
tongues would at once begin to wag."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Ulrica," I said, "I, for one, am very
much obliged to old Keppel for his hospitality;
but, nevertheless, I don't mean to be one of a party
shipped up and down the Mediterranean like a
cargo of coals.  I don't intend to sail again."
</p>

<p>
"What, dear!" she cried.  "Are you really
serious?  What's the cause of this sudden revolt?
</p>

<p>
"I'm bored to death," I replied.  "And there
are one or two persons on board that I intend to
avoid in future; Mrs. Langdon, for instance&mdash;the
old tabby!"
</p>

<p>
"Tabby is the correct term," Ulrica laughed.
"I've never been able to find out where old Keppel
discovered that rejuvenated skeleton.  Her paint
and powder are absolutely wicked."
</p>

<p>
"Listen, there's the breakfast bell," I said.
"We'll all go over to Pisa and do the amiable with
the others, and afterwards we must discover some
matter which requires our urgent presence on
shore&mdash;you understand?
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I leave the excuses to you, my dear; you're
so excellent at soft sawder.  Remember that at
all hazards I don't sail.  I hope you are equally
determined."
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite with you," she declared.  "Of course,
we don't want to offend the old gentleman, for he's
a useful person to know when one winters on the
Riviera.  Nevertheless, I quite agree that to be
shipped up and down the Mediterranean like this
is something beyond a joke.  I wonder why the
others stand it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why they stand it?  Because he's a millionaire,
and nearly all of them are indebted to him in
some way or other.  They can't demur.  It isn't
policy on their part to do so."
</p>

<p>
And so it was agreed between us that by hook
or by crook we should either forget to sail, or openly
present our apologies to our host.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast, always a merry meal when in
port, but sometimes a sparsely-attended one when
the mistral was blowing, we all took train to Pisa,
accompanied by Keppel <i>père et fils</i>, the latter
wishing us a temporary farewell and going on to
Florence, whence, he told us, he should return on
the following night to rejoin us on our cruise.
</p>

<p>
I knew that he had not the least intention of
doing so.  He had actually told Ulrica privately
that he was compelled to go by Milan and Bâle
to Berlin, on some pressing business for his father.
</p>

<p>
The day's excursion to see the Leaning Tower
and other wonders of the marble-built city by the
Arno was, as far as the others were concerned,
a success.  To Ulrica and myself, who acted as
guides, it was a day of absolute self-sacrifice.  The
only redeeming feature was the excellence of our
lunch at the little unpretending restaurant beside
the river, called the Nettuno.  Any of my readers
who have occasion to visit Pisa should remember
it, and should carefully avoid those glaring hotels
near the station, just as they should avoid the
station-buffet.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock we returned to Leghorn, wearied
out, and at half-past six dined together on board.
During the whole of the day I had managed to
attach myself to old Mr. Keppel, in order to watch
his movements; but, quite contrary to my
expectations, he did not excuse himself by saying
that he wished to make purchases; and further,
instead of remaining in Pisa, as I expected he would
do, he actually returned and took his usual seat at
the head of the dining-table.
</p>

<p>
There was music after dinner, and several of the
men, including the millionaire, went to the smoking-room.
</p>

<p>
Was it possible, I wondered, for him to have
again changed his plans?  I sat in the saloon until
nearly eight o'clock, but being anxious, I rose and
went up on deck, in order to ascertain whether our
host was still with his friends.
</p>

<p>
I passed the door of the smoking-room and peered
in, uttering some chaffing words with affected gaiety.
</p>

<p>
Keppel was not there.
</p>

<p>
"They are asking for Mr. Keppel in the saloon,"
I said.  "I thought he was here."
</p>

<p>
"No," responded Lord Stoneborough.  "He
went ashore a little time ago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks," I said.  "I'll tell them."
</p>

<p>
The millionaire had escaped me!
</p>

<p>
I dashed down to my cabin, and without hesitation
changed my dinner-frock for a dark stuff dress
that I had never worn on board; then, going
again on deck, I induced one of the sailors to row
me ashore at once, securing the man's silence by a
tip of half-a-sovereign.
</p>

<p>
If our eccentric host intended to leave Leghorn,
he must leave by train and return to Pisa.  Therefore
at the corner of the Via Grande I entered a
tram, and shortly afterwards alighted at the station.
The great platform was dimly lit and deserted,
for no train would depart, they told me, for another
hour.  It was the mail, and ran to Pisa to catch
the night express to the French frontier at Modane.
Most probably Keppel meant to catch this train.
</p>

<p>
Should I wait and watch?
</p>

<p>
The idea occurred to me that if that unseen
individual who had been present in the deck-house,
and had suggested the destruction of the
<i>Vispera</i>, had come ashore, he would certainly meet
Keppel somewhere.
</p>

<p>
The time dragged on.  The short train was
backed into the station, but no passenger appeared.
A controller inquired if I intended to go to Pisa,
but I replied in the negative.  At last several
passengers approached leisurely, as is usual in
Italy, one or two carrying wicker-covered flasks of
Chianti to drink in viaggio; the inevitable pair of
white-gloved carabineers strolled up and down, and
the train prepared to start.
</p>

<p>
Of a sudden, almost before I was aware of it, I
was conscious of two figures approaching.  One
was that of old Mr. Keppel, hot and hurrying,
carrying a small brown hand-bag, and the other
the figure of a woman, wearing a soft felt hat and
long fawn travelling-cloak.
</p>

<p>
I drew back into the shadow to allow them to
pass without recognising me.  The miscreant had,
it seemed to me, cleverly disguised himself as a
woman.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying, the next moment they passed me by
in search of an empty first-class compartment.
The controller approached them to ask for their
tickets.  Keppel searched his pockets in a fidgety
fashion, and said in English, which, of course, the
man did not understand:
</p>

<p>
"We're going to the frontier."
</p>

<p>
The man glanced leisurely at the tickets, unlocked
one of the doors, and allowed them to enter.
</p>

<p>
As the woman mounted into the carriage, however,
a ray of light fell straight across her face,
and revealed to my wondering eyes a countenance
that held me absolutely bewildered.
</p>

<p>
The discovery I made at that moment increased
the mystery tenfold.  The countenance disclosed by
the lamplight in the badly-lit station was not that
of a man in female disguise, as I had suspected,
but of a woman.  Her identity it was that held me
in amazement, for in that instant I recognised her
as none other than the dark-haired, handsome
woman whom I had seen lying dead upon the floor
of the deck-house on the previous night.
</p>

<p>
Why were they leaving the yacht in company?
What fresh conspiracy was there in progress?
</p>

<p>
I had always believed old Benjamin Keppel to be
the soul of honour, but the revelations of the past
few hours caused me utter bewilderment.  I stood
there in hesitation, and glancing up at the clock,
saw that there were still three minutes before the
departure of the train.  Next moment I had made
a resolve to follow them and ascertain the truth.
I entered the booking-office, obtained a ticket to
Modane, the French frontier beyond Mont Cenis,
and a few moments later was sitting alone in a
compartment at the rear of the train.  I had no
luggage, nothing whatever save the small travelling
reticule suspended from my waist-belt.  And I had
set out for an unknown destination!
</p>

<p>
The train moved off, and soon we were tearing
through the night across that wide plain which had
been the sea-bottom in those mediæval days when
the sculptured town of Pisa was a prosperous
seaport, the envy of both Florentines and Genoese,
and past the spot marked by a church where
St. Peter is said to have landed.  Well I knew that
wide Tuscan plain, with its fringe of high, vine-clad
mountains, for in my girlhood days I had wandered
over it, making my delighted way through the royal
forest and through the gracious vinelands.
</p>

<p>
At last, after three quarters of an hour, we ran
into the busy station at Pisa, that point so well
known to every tourist who visits Italy.  It is the
highway to Florence, Rome, and Naples, just as
it is to Genoa, Turin, or Milan; and just as the
traveller in Switzerland must at some time find
himself at Bâle, so does the traveller in Italy at
some time or other find himself at Pisa.  Yet how
few strangers who pass through, or who drive down
to look at the Leaning Tower and the great old
Cathedral, white as a marble tomb, ever take the
trouble to explore the country beyond.  They
never go up to quiet, grey, old Lucca, a town with
walls and gates the same to-day as when Dante
wandered there, untouched by the hand of the
vandal, unspoilt by modern progress, undisturbed
by tourist invaders.  Its narrow, old-world streets
of decaying palaces, its leafy piazzas, its Lily theatre,
its proud, handsome people, all are charming to one
who, like myself, loves Italy and the gay-hearted
Tuscan.
</p>

<p>
Little time was there for reflection, however, for on
alighting at Pisa I was compelled to conceal myself
until the arrival of the express on its way from Rome
to Paris.  While I waited, the thought occurred to
me that the <i>Vispera</i> was still in peril, and that
I alone could save her passengers and crew.  Yet,
with the mysterious woman still alive, there could,
I pondered, be no motive in destroying the vessel.
Perhaps the idea had happily been abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the non-appearance of the individual
whose voice I had heard, but whom I had not
seen, was disconcerting.  Try as I would, I could not
get rid of the suspicion aroused by Keppel's flight
that foul play was still intended.  If it were not,
why had the old millionaire not continued his cruise?
As the unknown woman had been concealed on
board for several weeks, there was surely no reason
why she should not have remained there another
three or four days, until we reached Marseilles!
No.  That some unusually strange mystery was
connected with the whole affair, I felt confident.
</p>

<p>
I peered out from the corner in which I was
standing, and saw Keppel and his companion enter the
buffet.  As soon as they had disappeared, I made a
sudden resolve, entered the telegraph office, and
wrote the following message:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>To Captain Davis.  S.Y. 'Vispera' in port,
Livorno.&mdash;Have altered arrangements.  Sail at once
for Genoa.  Box I spoke of will join you there.  Leave
immediately on receipt of this.</i>&mdash;KEPPEL."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I handed it in to the telegraphist, saying in
Italian:
</p>

<p>
"I want this delivered on board to-night, most
particularly."
</p>

<p>
He looked at it, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I fear, signorina," he answered, with grave
politeness, "that delivery is quite impossible.  It is
after hours, and the message will remain in the
office, and be delivered with letters in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"But it must reach the captain to-night," I
declared.
</p>

<p>
The man elevated his shoulders slightly, and
showed his palms.  This was the Tuscan gesture of
regret.
</p>

<p>
"At Livorno they are not, I am sorry to say,
very obliging."
</p>

<p>
"Then you believe it to be absolutely useless to
send the message, in the expectation of it being
delivered before morning?"
</p>

<p>
"The signorina understands me exactly."
</p>

<p>
"But what can I do?" I cried in desperation.
"This message must reach the captain before
midnight."
</p>

<p>
The man reflected for a moment.  Then he
answered me.
</p>

<p>
"There is but one way I can suggest."
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" I cried anxiously, for I heard
a train approaching, and knew it must be the Paris
express.
</p>

<p>
"To send a special messenger to Livorno.  A train
starts in half an hour, and the message can then be
delivered by 11 o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Could you find me one?" I asked.  "I'm willing
to bear all expenses."
</p>

<p>
"My son will go, if the signorina so wishes," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you so much," I replied, a great weight
lifted from my mind.  "I leave the matter entirely
in your hands.  If you will kindly see that the
message is delivered, you will be rendering, not only
to myself, but to a number of other people, a very
great service."
</p>

<p>
"The signorina's instructions shall be obeyed,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
When he had said this I placed some money to
cover expenses upon the counter, again thanked him,
and left, feeling that although I had been guilty of
forgery, I had saved the yacht from destruction.
</p>

<p>
The train, with its glaring head-lights, swept into
the station from its long journey across the
fever-stricken Maremma marshes, but I saw with
considerable dismay that there was but one
sleeping-car&mdash;the only through car for the frontier.  I was
therefore compelled to travel in this, even at the
risk of meeting Keppel in the corridor.  One cannot
well travel in one of those stuffy cars of the
Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits without
being seen by all one's fellow-travellers.  It was
thus my first difficulty presented itself.
</p>

<p>
I watched my host and his companion enter the
car, and from the platform saw them shown to
their respective berths by the conductor.  Keppel
was given a berth in a two-bed compartment with
another man, while the tall dark woman was shown
to one of the compartments reserved for ladies at
the other end of the car.
</p>

<p>
With satisfaction I saw the old millionaire take
his companion's hand and wish her good-night.
As soon as his door had closed, I mounted into the
car and demanded a place.
</p>

<p>
"The signorina is fortunate.  We have just one
berth vacant," answered the conductor in Italian.
"This way, please," and taking me along the
corridor, he rapped at the door of the compartment
to which he had just shown the mysterious woman.
</p>

<p>
I left it to the conductor to explain my presence,
and after entering, closed and bolted the door behind
me.
</p>

<p>
"I regret that I've been compelled to disturb you,
but this is the only berth vacant," I said in English,
in a tone of apology, for when I noticed that her
black eyes flashed inquiringly at me, I deemed it
best to be on friendly terms with her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it; I'm English," she answered,
quite affably.  "I'm pleased that you're English.
I feared some horrid foreign woman would be put
in to be my travelling companion.  Are you going
far?"
</p>

<p>
"To the frontier," I responded vaguely.  The
extent of my journey depended upon the length of
hers.
</p>

<p>
Then, after a further exchange of courtesies, we
prepared for the night and entered our narrow
berths, she choosing the upper one, and I the lower.
</p>

<p>
As far as I could judge, she was fifty, perhaps
more, though she was still extremely handsome, her
beauty being of a Southern type, and her black hair
and coiffure, with huge tortoise-shell comb, giving
her a Spanish appearance.  She wore several
beautiful rings, and I noticed that on her neck,
concealed during the day by her bodice, was some tiny
charm, suspended by a thin gold chain.  Her voice
and bearing were those of an educated woman, and
she was buxom without being at all stout.
</p>

<p>
The roar of the train and the grinding of the
wheels as we whirled through those seventy odd
suffocating tunnels that separate Pisa from Genoa
rendered sleep utterly impossible, so by mutual
agreement we continued our conversation.
</p>

<p>
She seemed, like the "Ancient Mariner," to be
needing someone to whom she could tell her story.
She wanted an audience able to realise the fine
points of her play.  From the outset she seemed
bursting with items about herself, little dreaming
that I was acting as spy upon her.
</p>

<p>
I secretly congratulated myself upon my astuteness,
and proceeded to draw her out.  Her slight
accent puzzled me, but it was due, I discovered, to
the fact that her mother had been Portuguese.
She seemed to label everything with her own
intellectual acquirements.  To me, a perfect stranger,
she chatted during that night-journey about her
fine figure and her power over men, about her
ambitions and her friends.  But her guardian
interfered with her friends.  He was an old man, and
jealous; had her money invested, and would not
allow her to look at a man.  If she paid the least
attention to any man in particular, she received no
money.  She was not forty, she told me, and her
guardian, who was also in the train, was over
seventy.
</p>

<p>
When she was not telling me the story of her
loves, and her father, mother, and step-father, she
filled in the time by telling me about some man she
called Frank, who had a pretty-faced wife addicted
to the bad habit known as secret drinking.
</p>

<p>
"Trouble?" she wandered on.  "Oh, I've had
such lots and lots of it that I'm beginning to feel
very old already.  Troubles, I always think, are
divided into two classes&mdash;one controlled by a
big-horned, cloven-hoofed devil, and the other by
the snippy little devil that flashes in and out of our
hearts.  The big devil is usually placed upon us
by others.  It follows us.  Sometimes we can evade
it, but at others it catches us up on its horns and
gives us a toss.  We come down into the dust,
crumpled, with all courage, ambition and hope
absorbed in despair.  We pick ourselves up in
desperation.  All that is best in us is so deadened that
even our consciences cannot hear a whisper; or,
on the other hand, we steel ourselves, and make a
resolve which lifts us to a moral and mental victory,
and to all that is noblest in ourselves and humanity."
</p>

<p>
I laughed, admitting that there was much truth
in her words.
</p>

<p>
"And the other&mdash;the little imp?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The other&mdash;this insane perversity of human
nature, gets hold on us whether we will or not.  It
makes us for the time ignore all that is best in
ourselves and in others&mdash;it is part of us.  Though
we know well it resides within ourselves, it will cause
our tears to flow and our sorrows to accumulate,
it is a fictitious substance, with possibly a mint of
happiness underlying it.  We are always conscious
of it, but insanity makes us ignore it for so long that
the little imp completes its work, and the opportunity
is lost.  But why are we moralising?" she
added.  "Let's try and get to sleep, shall we?"
</p>

<p>
To this I willingly acquiesced, for truth to tell, I
did not give credence to a single word of the rather
romantic story she had related regarding herself, her
friends, and her jealous guardian.  In these
post-Grundian days I had met women of her stamp many
times before.  The only way to make them feel is to
tell them the truth, devoid of all flattery.
</p>

<p>
She struck me as a woman with a past&mdash;her whole
appearance pointed to this conclusion.  Now a
woman with a chequered past and an untrammelled
present is always more or less interesting to women,
as well as to men.  She is a mystery.  The mystery
is that men cannot quite believe a smart woman
with knowledge, cut loose from all fetters, to be
proof against flattery.  She queens it, while they
study her.  Interest in a woman is only one step
from love for her&mdash;a fact with which we, the fairer
sex, are very well acquainted.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica had once expressed an opinion that pasts
were not so bad if it were not for the memories that
cling to them; not, of course, that the pasts of
either of us had been anything out of the ordinary.
Memories that cling to others, or the hints of a
"past," certainly make you of interest to men, as
well as a menace to the imagination of other women;
but the memories that hover about yourself are
sometimes like truths&mdash;brutal.
</p>

<p>
Memories!  As I lay there upon my hard and
narrow bed, being whirled through those suffocating
tunnels in the cliffs beside the Mediterranean, I
could not somehow get away from memory.  The
story this mysterious woman had related had
awakened all the sad recollections of my own life.  It
seemed as though an avalanche of cruel truths was
sweeping down upon my heart.  At every instant
memory struck a blow that left a scar deep and
unsightly as any made by the knife.  There was
tragedy in every one.  The first that came to me
was a day long ago.  Ah me!  I was young then&mdash;a
child in fears, a novice in experience&mdash;on that
day when I admitted to Ernest my deep and fervent
affection.  How brief it all had been!  I had,
alas! now awakened to the hard realities of life, and to
the anguish the heart is capable of holding.  The
sweetest part of love, the absolute trust, had died
long ago.  My heart had lost its lightness, never
to return, for his love toward me was dead.  His
fond tenderness of those bygone days was only a
memory.
</p>

<p>
Yet he must have loved me!  With me it had been
the love of my womanhood, the love that is born
with youth, that overlooks, forgives, and loves again,
that gives friendship, truth and loyalty.  What, I
wondered, were his thoughts when we had
encountered each other at Monte Carlo?  He showed
neither interest nor regret.  No.  He had cast me
aside, leaving me to endure that crushing sorrow and
brain torture which had been the cause of my long
illness.  He remembered nothing.  To him our
love was a mere incident.  It is no exaggeration to
describe memory as the scar of truth's cruel wound.
</p>

<p>
I lay there wondering to myself if ever again I
should feel any uplifting joy or any heartrending
sorrow.  Ah, if women could only outgrow the
child-part of their natures, hearts would not bleed
so much!  One of the greatest surprises in life is to
discover how acutely they can ache, how they can
be strained to the utmost tension, crowded with
agony, and yet not break.  This is moralising, and
smacks of sentiment, but it is true to nature, as
many of us are forced to learn.
</p>

<p>
The train roared on; the woman above me slept
soundly, and I, with tears starting to my eyes, tried
hard to burn the bridges leading to the past, and
seek forgetfulness in sleep.  The process of burning
can never be accomplished, thanks to our retentive
memory; but slumber came to me at last, and I
must have dozed some time, for when I awoke we
were in Genoa, and daylight was already showing
through the chinks of the crimson blinds.
</p>

<p>
But the woman who had told the curious story
slept on.  Probably the spinning of so much
romantic fiction had wearied her brain.  The story she
had related could not, of course, be true.  If she
were really old Keppel's ward, then what motive had
he in concealing her in that gilded deck-house, which
was believed to be stored with curios?  Who, too,
was that unseen man whom he had apparently taken
into his confidence&mdash;the man who had promised
assistance by blowing up the yacht, with all hands?
</p>

<p>
I shuddered at the thought of that dastardly plot.
</p>

<p>
Yet Keppel had been declared by this unknown
person to be the murderer of the woman now lying
in the berth above me.  Why?
</p>

<p>
The train was at a standstill, and I rose to peep
out.  As I turned to re-enter my berth, my eyes fell
upon the sleeping form of my companion.  Her face
was turned towards me, and her opened bodice
disclosed a delicate white throat and neck.
</p>

<p>
I bent quickly to examine more closely what I saw
there.  Upon the throat were two dark marks, one
on either side&mdash;the marks of a human finger and a
thumb&mdash;an exact repetition of the puzzling marks
that had been found upon the throat of poor
Reggie!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
IS MORE ASTONISHING
</h3>

<p>
So still, so pale, and so bloodless were my mysterious
companion's lips, that at the first moment I feared
she might be dead.  Her appearance was that of
a corpse.  But after careful watching I saw that she
was breathing lightly, but regularly, and thus I
became satisfied.
</p>

<p>
The curious marks, as though a man's hand had
attempted to strangle her, were of a pale yellowish-brown,
the colour of disappearing bruises.  One was
narrow and small, where the finger had pressed; the
other wide and long, the mark of the thumb.
</p>

<p>
Again I returned to my berth, and as the express
thundered on its way northward towards Turin, I
tried to form some theory to account for my
discovery of those curious marks upon her.
</p>

<p>
The hours of early morning crept slowly by.  The
sun rose over the beautiful vine-lands of Asti as we
whirled forward towards the great Alpine barrier
which so splendidly divides Italy from France; its
rays penetrated into our narrow chamber, but the
sleeping woman did not stir.  She seemed as one in
a trance.
</p>

<p>
Close beside me lay her dress-skirt.  My eyes had
been fixed upon it a hundred times during the night,
and it now occurred to me that by searching its
pocket I might discover something that would give
me a clue to her real identity.  Therefore, after
ascertaining that she was still unconscious of things
about her, I slowly turned over the skirt, placed my
hand in the pocket and drew out the contents.
</p>

<p>
The first object I opened was a silver-mounted
purse of crocodile leather, because in this I hoped to
discover her visiting-card.  But I was disappointed.
The purse contained only a few pieces of French
money, a couple of receipts from shops in Paris, and
a tiny scrap of card, an inch square, with several
numerals scribbled upon it.
</p>

<p>
The numbers were unintelligible, but when I
chanced to turn the piece of thin pasteboard over,
its reverse gave me an immediate clue.  It was a
piece of one of those red-and-black ruled cards used
by gamblers at Monte Carlo to register the numbers
at roulette.  This woman, whoever she was, had
evidently been to Monte Carlo, and the numbers
scribbled there were those which she believed would
bring her fortune.  Every gambler has her strong-rooted
fancies, just as she has her amusing superstitions,
and her belief in unlucky days and unlucky
croupiers.
</p>

<p>
Two facts were plain.  First, that she bore marks
upon her which were the exact counterpart of those
found on poor Reggie; secondly, that she herself
had been to Monte Carlo.
</p>

<p>
Her handkerchief was of fine lawn, but bore no
mark, while the crumpled piece of paper&mdash;without
which no woman's pocket is complete&mdash;proved, on
examination; to contain only the address of some
person in Brussels.
</p>

<p>
I carefully replaced all these articles, having failed
to ascertain her name; and then I dozed again.
She was already up, and dressed, when I awoke.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she laughed, "I see you've been sleeping
well.  I've had a famous night.  I always sleep well
when I travel.  But I have a secret.  A doctor
friend of mine gave me some little tabloids of some
narcotic&mdash;I don't know its name&mdash;but if I take one
I sleep quite well for six or seven hours at a
stretch."
</p>

<p>
"I awoke once, and you were quite sound asleep."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," she laughed.  "But I wonder where
we are?"
</p>

<p>
I looked forth, and was just able to read the name
of a small station as we dashed through it at a
glorious speed.
</p>

<p>
"We're nearing Turin," I responded.  Then suddenly
recollecting that in an hour or so I should be
compelled to face old Keppel in the corridor, I
resolved on a plan, which I immediately proceeded to
put in force.  "I don't feel at all well this morning,"
I added.  "I think I shall go to sleep again."
</p>

<p>
"I've some smelling salts here," she said, looking
at me with an expression of sympathy.  And she
took out a small silver-topped bottle from her little
reticule.
</p>

<p>
I took it and sniffed it gladly, with a word of
thanks.  If I did not wish to meet Keppel, I should
be compelled to remain in that stuffy little den for
something like another twenty-four hours, if the
travellers intended to go on to Paris.  The prospect
was certainly not inviting, for a single night in a
Continental sleeping-car running over a badly-laid line
gets on one's nerves terribly.  Compelled, however,
to feign illness, I turned in again, and at Turin, while
my companion went forth and rejoined the man who
had been my host, the conductor brought me the
usual glass of hot coffee and a roll.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not well," I explained to the man who
handed it to me.  "Are you going through to Paris?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, signorina."
</p>

<p>
"Then please don't let me be disturbed, either at
the frontier or anywhere else."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly&mdash;if the signorina has the keys of her
baggage."
</p>

<p>
"I have no baggage," I replied.  "Only see that
I get something to eat&mdash;and buy me a novel.
Italian, French&mdash;anything will do.  And also some
newspapers&mdash;<i>Stampa</i>, <i>Corriere</i>, and <i>Secolo</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Si, signorina."  And the door was closed.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, just as the train was gliding out
of Turin, the man returned with a couple of new
novels and half a dozen four-paged, badly-printed
Italian newspapers, by means of which I managed
to wile away the tedious hours as we sped on through
Susa and the beautiful Alpine valleys.
</p>

<p>
From time to time my companion looked in to see
how I was, offering to do anything for me that she
could; then she returned to old Keppel, who was
sitting on one of the little flap-seats in the corridor,
smoking.
</p>

<p>
"The woman in with me is rather young&mdash;and
quite charming," I heard her say to him.  "She's
been taken queer this morning.  I expect the heat
has upset her, poor thing!  The berths here are
very hot and close."
</p>

<p>
"Horribly!  I was nearly asphyxiated," he answered.
</p>

<p>
Then, about half an hour later, I recognised his
voice again.  He was evidently standing with his
companion close to the door of my compartment.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be in Paris about half-past eight
to-morrow morning, it seems," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And the <i>Vispera</i> will be awaiting you at
Naples?" she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Davis is quite used to my erratic movements,"
he answered.  "A reputation for eccentricity is very
useful sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"But shall you rejoin her?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I think it is most unlikely," he answered.  "I've
had enough of cruising.  You, too, must be very
tired of it."
</p>

<p>
"Tired!" she cried.  "Imprisoned in the cabin
all day long, with the windows closed and curtained,
I felt that if it lasted much longer I must go mad.
Besides, it was only by a miracle that I was not
discovered a dozen times."
</p>

<p>
"But very fortunately you were not," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And all to no purpose," she observed, in a tone
of weariness and discontent.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's another matter&mdash;quite another matter."
</p>

<p>
"I do wish you would satisfy my curiosity by
telling me exactly what occurred on the night before
we landed," she said.  "You know what I mean?"
</p>

<p>
She evidently referred to the attempt upon her
life.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he responded, in hesitation, "I myself am
not quite clear as to what took place.  I entered the
cabin, you know, and found you lying unconscious."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  I was thrown violently down by
a sudden lurching of the ship, and must have struck
my head against something," she replied.  "But
afterwards I remember experiencing a most curious
sensation in my throat, just as though someone with
sinewy fingers were trying to strangle me."
</p>

<p>
"Absurd!" he laughed.  "It was only your
imagination.  The close confinement in that place,
together with the rolling of the ship, had caused you
a little light-headedness, without a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"But it was more than imagination.  Of that I
feel certain.  There was blood upon my lips, you
remember."
</p>

<p>
"Because in falling you had cut your lower lip.
I can see the place now."
</p>

<p>
"I believe that someone tried to take my life."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!  Why, who is there to suspect?  I
was the only soul on board who knew of your
presence.  Surely you don't suspect me of attempting
murder?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," she answered decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't give way to any wild imaginings of
that sort.  Keep a cool head in this affair."
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the conversation was lost to me,
although I strained my ears to catch every sound.
His words made it plain that she was in ignorance of
the knowledge possessed by the unseen man whose
voice I had overheard; and further, that both were
acting together in order to obtain some object, the
nature of which was, to me, a complete mystery.
</p>

<p>
She came a short time afterwards and kindly
inquired how I felt.  They were going to change into
the dining-car, and she hoped I would not starve
altogether.  As I talked to her I recollected the
strange marks I had seen upon her throat&mdash;those
distinct impressions of finger and thumb.  I looked
again for them, but they were concealed by the lace
of her high-necked bodice.  There seemed a strange,
half-tragic beauty about her face.  She was certainly
fifty, if not more, yet in the broad daylight I could
detect no thread of silver in her hair.  She was
extremely well-preserved.
</p>

<p>
The conductor brought me a cutlet and a bottle of
Beaujolais after we had passed through the Mont
Cenis, and for some hours afterwards I lay reading
and thinking.  We were on our way to Paris, but
with what motive I had no idea.
</p>

<p>
I wondered what they would think on board the
<i>Vispera</i> when they found me to be missing, and
laughed aloud when I reflected that the natural
conclusion would be that I had eloped with old
Mr. Keppel.  I rather regretted that I had told Ulrica
nothing, but, of course, a telegram to her could
explain everything on the morrow.  The yacht would
be lying safely in Genoa harbour awaiting her owner,
who never intended to return.
</p>

<p>
And where was that unseen man?  That was a
puzzling problem which I could not solve.  I could
not even form the slightest theory as to his share in
the mystery.
</p>

<p>
The day passed slowly, and evening fell.  We were
nearing Culoz.  The woman with the mysterious
marks upon her neck returned, accompanied by her
escort, from the dining-car, and sat chatting with
him in the corridor.  Their voices reached me, but I
could distinguish little of their conversation.
Suddenly, however, I thought I could hear a third voice
in conversation&mdash;the voice of a man.
</p>

<p>
It sounded familiar.  I listened again.  Yes, it
seemed as though I had heard that voice somewhere
before.  Indeed, I knew its tones perfectly well.
</p>

<p>
For some few minutes I lay listening, trying to
catch the words.  But the train was roaring through
a deep cutting, and I could only hear disjointed
words, or parts of sentences.
</p>

<p>
In my determination to see who it was, I carefully
opened the door of the compartment, so that I could
peer through the chink.
</p>

<p>
I bent forward until my eyes rested upon the
speaker, who, lounging near, was engaged in serious
conversation with Keppel and my travelling
companion, as though he were an old friend.
</p>

<p>
In an instant I drew back and held my breath.
Was this the man who had suggested the blowing up
of the <i>Vispera</i>?  Surely not!  Perhaps, however,
he had actually travelled with us from Pisa in
another carriage, or perhaps he had joined the train
at some intermediate station.  But by whatever
means he had come there, the fact of his identity
remained the same.
</p>

<p>
It was Ernest Cameron, the man I loved!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
CONFIDES THE STORY OF A TABLE
</h3>

<p>
The discovery of Ernest's presence in the car was an
entirely fresh development of the mystery.  I had
been ignorant of his acquaintance with Keppel, but
that they were really close friends was evident by
the rapid, rather apprehensive manner in which they
were conversing.
</p>

<p>
I tried, and tried again, to overhear some of the
words spoken; but in vain!  Therefore I was
compelled to remain in wonderment until the conclusion
of that long and terribly tiring journey half across
Europe.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the Gare de Lyons in Paris, I entered
a fiacre, and followed them across the city to the
"Hôtel Terminus," that big caravansery outside the
Gare St. Lazare, where they engaged four rooms on
the first floor&mdash;a sitting-room and three bedrooms.
Having taken every precaution to avoid being
detected by either of them, I ascertained that the
number of the sitting-room was 206.  I at once
engaged Number 205, the room adjoining, and ordered
a light <i>déjeuner</i> to be taken there.  I was faint,
nervous, and tired after being cramped up for thirty
hours, and was resting on the couch, when suddenly
voices sounded in the next room, causing me to
spring up and be on the alert in an instant.
</p>

<p>
Keppel and Ernest were speaking together,
</p>

<p>
"It's a risk, of course," the millionaire was saying
in a low tone&mdash;"a great risk."
</p>

<p>
"But we've run greater in the course of this
affair," the other responded.  "You know how near
to arrest I have been."
</p>

<p>
I held my breath.  Arrest!  What could he mean?
</p>

<p>
"It was fortunate that you escaped as you did."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to you.  Had you not concealed me on
the <i>Vispera</i>, and taken me on that cruise, I should
have now been in the hands of the police."
</p>

<p>
"But they seem to possess no clue," Keppel
observed.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately for us, they do not," answered
the man to whom I had given my heart.  And he
laughed lightly, as though he were perfectly
confident of his own safety.  "It was that transfer of
the notes at the Carnival ball that puzzled them."
</p>

<p>
They were speaking of poor Reggie's murder!
</p>

<p>
I held my ear close to the dividing door, straining
to catch every word.  I was learning their secret.
The two men whom I had least suspected were
actually implicated in that dastardly crime.  But
what, I wondered, could have been their motive
in taking the poor boy's life?  Certainly robbery
was not the incentive, for to old Keppel sixty
thousand francs was but a paltry sum.
</p>

<p>
Again I listened, but as I did so the woman
entered, and shortly afterwards the two men left
the room and went down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
In an instant I resolved to follow them.  Before
they had gained the entrance-hall I had put on my
hat and descended.  They took a cab and first drove
up the hill behind St. Lazare to the Boulevard des
Battignolles, alighting before a large house where,
from an old <i>concierge</i> in slippers, Ernest received
two letters.  Both men stood in the doorway and
read the communications through.  I had followed
in a cab.  From their faces I could see that the
letters contained serious news, and for some minutes
they stood in discussion, as though undecided what
to do.
</p>

<p>
At length, however, they re-entered the cab and
drove back past the Opera, through the Rue Rivoli
and across the Pont des Arts, turning into a labyrinth
of narrow, dirty streets beyond the Seine, and stopping
before a small, uninviting-looking hairdresser's
shop.  They were inside for some ten minutes or so,
while I stood watching a short distance off, my head
turned away so that they should not recognise me if
they came out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
When they emerged they were laughing good-humouredly,
and were accompanied to the door by
a rather well-dressed man, evidently a hairdresser,
for a comb protruded from his pocket, and his hair
was brushed up in that style peculiar to the Parisian
<i>coiffeur</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Good-day, messieurs," he said in French, bowing
them into the fiacre, "I understand quite clearly.
There is nothing to fear, I assure you&mdash;absolutely
nothing!"
</p>

<p>
In that man's dark eyes, as he stood watching the
cab as it drove off, was a strangely intense look.
His face was triangular, with broad forehead and
pointed chin.  I imagined him to have a rather
curious personality.  Again I looked at his peculiarly
brilliant eyes, and a strange truth flashed upon me.
Yes, I remembered that curious expression quite
distinctly.
</p>

<p>
He was the man who had worn the owl's dress in
Carnival&mdash;the man who had returned to me the
notes stolen from poor Reggie!  He was an accomplice
of the two men of whom I had never entertained
the least suspicion.
</p>

<p>
The truth had been revealed in so amazing a
fashion that I was completely staggered.  Ernest
was an assassin!  Had he not admitted how near he
had been to arrest, and congratulated himself upon
his escape?  Had not old Keppel aided him by
concealing him on board the <i>Vispera</i>?  Once, alas! I
had in the roseate days of youth believed in the
man who had made love to me; who had flattered
and caressed me, and who had declared that I should
be his always.  Ah! how well I remembered it!
How bitterly all the past came back to me.  And
yet, until that very hour of my discovery that he
was an assassin I had never ceased to love
him&mdash;never for a single instant.  We women are strange
creatures.
</p>

<p>
I re-entered the cab, but in the Boulevard
St. Michel my driver unfortunately lost sight of the
men I had told him to keep in view.  They must,
I think, have turned suddenly into one of the many
side streets, and thus reached the Quai.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments I sat back in hesitation.
Should I return at once to the hotel, or should I
go boldly to that man whom I had so fortunately
discovered, and charge him with having had in
his possession the stolen notes?  If I adopted
the latter course, I saw that I should only raise an
alarm, and the pair I was watching would undoubtedly
get clear away.  No.  The old proverb that
"murder will out" had once more asserted its
truth.  I had made a most amazing discovery, and
now my love for Ernest as a man having been
transformed to hatred of him as an assassin, I meant
slowly to weave a web about the criminals, and when
it was complete, I intended to give information to
the police, and thus avenge the poor boy's death.
</p>

<p>
I drove to the nearest telegraph-office and wired
to Genoa, urging Ulrica to come to Paris without
delay, for I sorely needed the counsel of the woman
who was my best friend.
</p>

<p>
Then I returned to the "Hôtel Terminus."  As I
heard no one in the sitting-room adjoining, I lay
down to rest, sleeping soundly, for my nerves were
unstrung, and I was utterly worn out by fatigue
and constant watchfulness.
</p>

<p>
When I awoke it was past seven o'clock, and
quite dark.  There was still no movement in the
sitting-room adjoining.  I dressed, and went across
to dine at the Duval, over at the corner of the Rue
du Havre, preferring that cheap restaurant to the
<i>table d'hôte</i> of the hotel, where I might possibly meet
the three persons upon whom I was keeping watch.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, just as I was crossing the road to
re-enter the hotel, I saw a man standing alone on
the steps in hesitation.  He wore a dark beard, and
carried a long drab overcoat, such as men generally
affect on race-courses; but notwithstanding his
disguise, I perceived that it was Ernest.  The beard
made him look much older, and by the addition of
a few lines to his face he had entirely altered his
appearance.  For some moments he puffed pensively
at his cigar, then, glancing at his watch,
descended the steps and strolled slowly along past
the "Café Terminus," and continued to walk
down the Rue du Havre as far as the Boulevard
Haussmann, where he stopped before that popular
rendezvous of Parisians, the "Grand Café."
</p>

<p>
After he had selected one of the tables, the last
one towards the Madeleine, placed against the
wall of the café, he ordered a coffee and liqueur.
The night was bright, and the Boulevards, with their
blazing globes of electricity, were full of life and
movement.
</p>

<p>
From where I was sitting, at a small <i>brasserie</i> on
the opposite side of the Boulevard, I watched him
narrowly.  He glanced up and down as though in
constant expectation of meeting someone, and
looked at his watch impatiently.  He tossed off
his <i>liqueur</i> at a single gulp, but his coffee remained
untasted, for it was evident that he was in a state of
deep agitation.  He had feared arrest for the
murder of Reginald Thorne, and had taken refuge
secretly on the <i>Vispera</i>.  Were not his own words
sufficient to convince me of his guilt?
</p>

<p>
As I looked I saw him, while in the act of
pretending to sip his coffee, bend down close to the
marble table, which, after making certain that he
was not observed, he scrutinised carefully.  Twice
he bent to look at it closely.  Surely, I thought,
there must be something of interest marked on that
slab.  Then he glanced at his watch again, paid, and
strolled off down the Boulevard.
</p>

<p>
Whether to follow or whether to investigate that
table, I was for the moment undecided; but I
resolved upon the latter course.  I crossed the road,
made straight for the seat he had occupied, and
as soon as I had ordered a <i>dubonnet</i>, proceeded to
examine the table.  Very quickly I discovered
what had interested him.  Scrawled in pencil upon
the marble were some letters quite unintelligible,
but evidently a cipher message.  It was no more
than this:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  J. TABAC.  22.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another inscription had been written there, but
it had been lately erased by some previous customer,
who had apparently dipped his finger in the drippings
of beer or coffee, and smeared it across.  The
writing was not very easy to discern in the half-light,
for the table was so placed as to be in the deep
shadows.  Was it possible that the person who had
erased the first message had written the second?
Could it be that this person was the man whom I had
been watching?
</p>

<p>
I had seen him bend over that table mysteriously,
first glancing round to make certain that no one
was watching.  Why had he thus betrayed fear, if
that message was not one of importance?  Goron,
the great <i>chef</i> of the Paris <i>sûreté</i>, had told me, when I
met him at dinner once in London, how the criminals
of Paris were fond of making the tops of the café
tables the means of communication, and how many a
crime had been discovered by the police with the
aid of the keys they possessed to certain secret
codes.
</p>

<p>
I looked again at the initial, the word "tabac," and
the number 22 scrawled on the marble before me,
and was puzzled to know what they could convey.
Had Ernest really written them?  The letters were
printed, in order, no doubt, to prevent any
recognition of the handwriting.  I remembered that he
had sat with his hand upon the table, as though
toying idly with the matches; and further, I noticed
that the liquid with which the erasure had been
made was not yet entirely dry.  I touched it with
my gloved finger and placed it to my nose.  There
was an odour of coffee.
</p>

<p>
Now, if Ernest had really written that cipher
message, he had substituted his for the one he had
found standing there.  With what purpose?  To
whom was this unintelligible word addressed?
Having regard to the fact that the tables of cafés
are usually washed down by the waiters every
morning, it seemed plain that the person to whom he
intended to convey the message would come there
that night.  Indeed, he had constantly looked at his
watch, as though in expectation of the arrival of
someone.
</p>

<p>
I paid the <i>garçon</i> and left, returning some few
minutes later to my previous place in front of the
brasserie opposite, determined to wait and watch.
The attendant brought me some illustrated papers,
and while pretending to be absorbed in them, I kept
my eye upon the table I had just vacated.  A shabby,
small, wizen-faced man in a silk hat, with a flat
brim, passed and re-passed the spot where I was
sitting, and, it seemed, eyed me rather suspiciously.
But perhaps it was only my fancy, for when one is
engaged in the work of bringing home to a criminal
his crime, one is apt to look with undue suspicion
upon all and sundry.
</p>

<p>
I think I must have been there nearly half an
hour before a ragged, unkempt man, who had slunk
past where I was seated and picked up several
cigar-ends with a stick bearing a sharpened wire
point, crossed over to the "Grand Café" and
recommenced his search beneath the tables there.
When he had secured some half-a-dozen cigar-ends,
he moved quickly to the table in the shadow; and
as he stooped, feigning to pick up a piece of
unconsumed cigar, I saw that he glanced eagerly to
see what message was written there.
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment the wizen-faced man who had
evinced such an extraordinary interest in myself was
standing idly upon the kerb close by, and was
undoubtedly watching him.
</p>

<p>
The quick eyes of the old collector of cigar-ends
apparently understood the message in an instant,
for with back bent he continued his active search,
betraying no further interest in that table in the
shadow.  If he had really gone there in order to
ascertain the nature of the message, he concealed
his real purpose admirably.  Probably he was used
to being watched by police agents.  I saw him
hobble along from café to café, his shrewd, deep-set
eyes peering from beneath his shaggy brows, always
in search of the small pieces of tobacco discarded by
smokers.
</p>

<p>
With him also disappeared the shabby little
man whose interest I had unwittingly aroused,
and I remained alone, still irresolute and wondering.
</p>

<p>
I had paid, and was just about to rise and go,
when of a sudden a smart victoria pulled up in front
of the "Grand Café," and from it stepped a
well-dressed woman, wearing a smart hat and an
elaborate cape of the latest <i>mode</i>.  Without hesitation
she walked to the table in question and seated
herself.  In the darkness I could not distinguish her
face, but I saw that even before the waiter could
attend to her she had examined the table and read
the message there written.
</p>

<p>
Was it, I wondered, intended for her?
</p>

<p>
The waiter brought what she ordered, a "bock,"
that favourite beverage with both Parisians and
Parisiennes.  I watched her narrowly, and at once
saw something to convince me that the cipher was
intended for her eye.  She dipped her finger in the
beer, and when no one was looking, drew it across the
writing.
</p>

<p>
Was she young, or old, I wondered?  She was settling
her cape and chiffons preparatory to rising and
re-entering her carriage; I also rose and crossed the
road.  As I stepped upon the asphalt on the opposite
side, she crossed to where her smart carriage
stood, brushing past me as she did so.
</p>

<p>
As the light fell across her face there was revealed
to me a countenance with which I was only too
familiar.
</p>

<p>
She was the woman who had usurped my place in
Ernest's heart; the woman whom I had seen in
his company at Monte Carlo; the woman who had
laughed at me in triumph across the roulette table,
because she knew that she held him beneath the
spell of her insipid beauty.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
IN WHICH MATTERS ASSUME A VERY COMPLEX ASPECT
</h3>

<p>
I started to walk along the Boulevard towards the
Opera.  To that woman with the tow-coloured hair,
the blue eyes and pink cheeks&mdash;the woman who had
replaced me in his affections&mdash;Ernest had written
that strange message in cipher, a message of warning
it might be.  I hated her.  I really believe that if
ever the spirit of murder has entered my heart, it
was at that moment.  I could have sprung upon her
and killed her as she stepped into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
She had said no word to her coachman.  He
apparently knew where to drive.  That cipher was
perhaps an appointment which he had gone
forward to keep, while she was now following.  The
thought convulsed me with anger.  This man,
Ernest Cameron, the man who had once held me
in his arms and declared that he loved me, was, upon
his own admission, an assassin.
</p>

<p>
I had somehow ceased to think of the old
millionaire and the chattering woman whom he had
concealed on board the <i>Vispera</i>.  All my thoughts were
of the man who had, until then, held me as his
helpless slave.
</p>

<p>
It may have been jealousy, or it may possibly
have been the revulsion of feeling that had seized
me on becoming aware of the terrible truth of his
guilt, that caused me to vow to leave no stone
unturned to secure his arrest and condemnation.  I
would follow her.  She, that slim woman with the
fair hair, had stolen him from me, but I determined
that she should not be allowed to enjoy his society
much longer.  I had discovered the truth, and the
blow that I intended to deal would be fatal to the
happiness of both of them.
</p>

<p>
I laughed within myself as I got into a fiacre,
and told the driver to keep her carriage in sight.  I
was not impatient.  I would wait and watch until
I had secured ample proof.  Then I had but to
apply to the police, and the arrest would be made.
He, Ernest Cameron, had murdered and robbed the
poor boy who had admired me, and with whom I
had so foolishly flirted.  It was the attention I
had allowed him to pay to me that was primarily
the cause of his assassination.  Of that I had always
been convinced.  The moral responsibility rested
upon myself.
</p>

<p>
I followed her straight up the Rue Lafayette to
the Gare du Nord, where she alighted, and after
speaking a moment with her coachman, dismissed
her carriage.  She evidently intended to leave
Paris.  I crept up quickly behind her in the long
booking-office, and followed her in order to overhear
her destination.
</p>

<p>
"First-class return to Enghien, please," she asked
the girl who sold the tickets.
</p>

<p>
Enghien!  I had heard of the place as being a
popular resort near Paris, famous for its sulphur
baths; but in what direction it lay, I had not the
slightest idea.  Nevertheless, the fact of her taking
a return ticket, and having no baggage, showed
that she did not intend to make a protracted stay.
Therefore, when she was out of hearing, I took a
ticket for the same destination; the price showed
me that the distance could not be very great.
</p>

<p>
Secretly following her, I entered a train, and in
half-an-hour alighted at a small suburban station,
which was rather dimly lit.  Outside, she entered a
fiacre.  Following her quickly, I drove through
the narrow street of the little French town to the
shore of a small lake, from which arose a strong
and disagreeable odour of sulphur.  She disappeared
into the gaily-lit entrance of an illuminated
garden, which I discovered to be the Casino of
Enghien, an establishment where public gambling
was permitted, and where there was a celebrated
so-called <i>cercle</i> for baccarat.  The place consisted
of a garden extending along the shore of the lake,
together with a large open-air café, a big
theatre&mdash;where a variety performance was in progress&mdash;and
beyond, the public gaming-room, play in which
proved to be of the usual kind permitted at French
and Belgian resorts.
</p>

<p>
It was a decidedly pretty place.  The long festoons
of coloured lights were reflected in the lake,
while out towards the pine-covered island were
many small boats decorated with paper lanterns.
In the garden there was quite a crowd of Parisians,
who had gone there in the evening to lounge in the
fresh air, or to stake their francs upon the little
horses or upon the miniature railway.  The band
was playing, and the smart pleasure-seekers were
promenading over the gravelled walks, laughing
gaily, and chatting merrily.
</p>

<p>
The woman upon whom I was keeping such a
close watch strolled through the gardens, peering
hither and thither, as though in search of someone.
It was the <i>entr'acte</i>, and the theatre, one side of
which was open towards the garden, had emptied.
At Enghien the <i>entr'actes</i> are long, in order to allow
people to go to the gaming-room.  Two men I
recognised as <i>habitués</i> at Monte Carlo, one of them
middle-aged, well-dressed and black-bearded, who
invariably wore white kid gloves.  He was half
bald, and his face showed marks of premature age
brought on by dissipation.  The other, who was
younger, was his partner.  They were well-known
figures at Monte Carlo, and had evidently left
there and come north, now that, the season being
over, there were no more pigeons to be plucked
in the private gaming-rooms of the Riviera.
</p>

<p>
The woman at length took a seat at one of the
café tables, deep in the shadow of a tree, and ordered
a <i>consommation</i>.  I suspected that she had an
appointment with someone, and therefore resolved
to watch.  As far as I could observe, she had never
once detected my presence, and if she did now,
she most probably would not recognise me, dressed
as I was in an old stuff gown.  She had seen me, I
recollected, in the smart Monte Carlo toilettes, in
which I presented such a different appearance.  I
took up a position on one of the seats by the
lakeside, opposite the café, a spot from which I could
see all that might come to pass.
</p>

<p>
I must here admit that my continual search was
growing terribly wearisome.  Unused to acting the
spy, my nerves had been during those days of
travel and adventure strained to their utmost
tension.  For five nights sleep had scarcely come
to my eyes, so constant was the vigil I had kept,
and for five days I had existed in feverish anxiety
on the very horns of a dilemma.  I sat there watching
the passing crowd of gay Parisiennes, and
breathing the fresh evening air from across the
lake.  On the other shore were large mansions,
with their lawns sloping down to the water,
reminding me of English houses on the upper reaches
of the Thames.  From time to time a night-bird
skimmed the placid water, causing it to eddy in
the starlight.  From across the water came feminine
laughter from a passing boat, and a girl's voice
reached me from far away, trilling the refrain of
Paulette Darty's "romance-waltz," which I
supposed had just been sung in the café-concert:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Donne-moi ta lèvre, ta lèvre rose,<br>
  Qu'amoureusement ma lèvre s'y pose<br>
  Et qu'étroitement tous deux enlacés<br>
  Nos querelles soient querelles de baisers."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yes, the scene was certainly charmfxing.  I, like
thousands of the people who go to Paris, and who
know the Rue Rivoli better than they do Oxford
Street, had never troubled to spend an evening at
Enghien.  The Casino would really be a delightful
one were it not for the presence of that curse to
French and Belgian popular resorts&mdash;the <i>tapis vert</i>.
Dozens of similar places are spoilt by the
introduction of those tables, for play and the
<i>demi-monde</i> are inseparable, just as are baccarat and
blackguards.
</p>

<p>
The electric bells had rung to announce that the
variety entertainment was about to be resumed,
and the crowd from the gaming-room and from
the garden was making its way back to the theatre,
to be entertained by the drolleries of Paulus and
the risky <i>chansons</i> of Liane de Vries, when, of a
sudden, I noticed that the woman who had stolen
my lover's heart had half-risen and given her hand
to a stranger, evidently the man she had been
expecting.
</p>

<p>
He was short of stature, and well-dressed, for in
the shadow where he stood I could see the wide
expanse of starched shirt-front displayed by his open
overcoat, and could tell that he wore an opera-hat.
</p>

<p>
She re-seated herself, evidently pleased by his
arrival, while he stood for a moment bending
towards her and speaking earnestly.  Then he
drew back, laughed merrily, and seated himself
opposite her.
</p>

<p>
He sat back in the half-darkness, so that I was
unable to distinguish his face.  But his presence
there was sufficient to tell me that this woman, by
whom Ernest had been fascinated, was a worthless
person, who made secret assignations unknown to
the unfortunate man, who probably believed her
to be the very paragon of all the virtues.
</p>

<p>
How would Ernest act if he were aware of the
actual truth?  I wondered.  Would he still have
confidence in his pink-and-white doll?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps.  Men are incomprehensible creatures
where their love is concerned.  When fascinated
by a woman's smile, they will lick the hand that
cuffs them; they will allow Aspasia to drench them
with <i>vin mousseux</i>, to smother them with chiffons,
to stifle them with <i>mots</i>, and to sell them for
<i>rouleaux</i>, and yet make no audible complaint.
</p>

<p>
To love and to hate seem to be the two things
which it is most natural and most easy for women
to do.  In these two principles how many of the
actions of our lives originate.  How important is it,
therefore, that we should learn early in life to love
and hate aright.  Most women believe that they
love virtue and hate vice.  But have the majority
of them clearly ascertained what virtue and vice
are?  Have they examined the meaning of these
important words?  Have they listened to the
plausible reasoning of what we call Society, where
things are spoken of by false names, and where
vice is vulgar in the common herd, but sanctioned
as <i>chic</i> among the select few?  Or have they gone
directly to the eternal and immutable principles of
good and evil?
</p>

<p>
I must confess that, tutored by Ulrica, I had long
ago listened to Society's reasonings, and had thus
become a worldly woman.  Now a worldly woman
is necessarily a woman possessing tact, and able at
the same time to tell untruths with grace, and
successfully to act a part whenever necessary.
</p>

<p>
Woman is gifted by nature with a remarkable
quickness of perception, by means of which she is
able to detect the earliest approach of aught
tending to destroy that high-toned purity of character
for which, even in the days of chivalry, she was
more reverenced and adored than for her beauty
itself.  This quickness of perception in minute and
delicate points, with the power which woman also
possesses of acting upon it instantaneously, has, in
familiar phraseology, obtained the name of tact;
and when this natural gift is added to good taste,
the two combined are of more value to a woman
in the social and domestic affairs of every-day life
than the most brilliant and intellectual endowments
could be without them.
</p>

<p>
You, my friend and confidante, know well that
when a woman is possessed of a high degree of tact,
she sees, as if by a kind of second sight, when
any little emergency is likely to occur; or when,
to use a more familiar expression, things do not
seem likely to go right.  She is thus aware of any
sudden turn in conversation, and prepared for what
it may lead to; but above all, she can penetrate into
the state of mind of those with whom she is placed
in contact, so as to detect the gathering gloom
upon another's brow, before the mental storm shall
have reached any formidable height; to know when
the tone of voice has altered, when an unwelcome
thought has presented itself, and when the pulse
of feeling is beating higher or lower in consequence
of some apparently trifling circumstance which has
just come to pass.
</p>

<p>
Most women flatter themselves upon this valuable
acquirement, and the scandal-monger most of all.
In the life of every woman there have been critical
moments, when this natural intuition has led her
into a knowledge of the truth.  During the days
when I was acting as a spy, my quickness of
perception was put to the test times without number,
and again there, in the Casino of Enghien-les-Bains,
I was compelled to exercise all my woman's cunning.
</p>

<p>
The man who had just joined the fair lounger
beneath the tree was, I judged, much beneath
middle height, but in the darkness height is always
deceptive.  All I could see distinctly was that he
wore a black overcoat, a black tie, and either white
or lavender gloves.  Evidently he was of that type
of male elegant commonly to be seen in the
neighbourhood of public gaming-tables.  Men of this
type are usually hard-up, live by sponging on
friends, affect a rather select circle, and are the
leaders of masculine fashion.  The Italians call a
man belonging to this class a <i>duca senza ducati</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was leaning his elbows upon the table, and
had entered into an earnest conversation.  Both
heads were bent together, and he was apparently
relating some facts which were, to her, of the utmost
interest, for now and then she shrugged her narrow
shoulders, and gesticulated with not a little
vivacity.  I was, however, too far off to overhear a
single syllable of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
The man, I saw, had taken from his pocket some
letters, one of which she held in her hand, bending
forward into the light so as to read it.  What she
read apparently angered her, for she tossed it back
to him in disgust, and struck her hand upon the
table with a quick ejaculation.  This caused some
words between them.  I imagined that, in her
outburst of temper, she had made some charge against
him which he now stoutly denied, for of a sudden
both were gesticulating violently.  As most of the
promenaders had entered the theatre, the garden
was at that moment practically deserted; but the
orchestra in the illuminated bandstand was
playing, drowning all their words, and preventing
attention being directed to their altercation.
</p>

<p>
I sat there by the lake-side, watching with
breathless interest.  What would I not have given to be
sufficiently near to catch the drift of their
conversation!
</p>

<p>
Presently, in the height of their argument, he
pushed a second letter before her face roughly, as
though to convince her of his words; but she,
seeing in his action a desire to insult her, snatched
the letter from his hands, tore it into fragments,
and cast them in his face.
</p>

<p>
It was done in an instant, and sitting as they
were in that secluded corner in the shadow, none
witnessed the incident save myself.
</p>

<p>
The man rose quickly, with an air of fierce resentment,
bowed to her with mock courtesy, and strode
off.  But as he passed out into the gaslight, I saw
his face, and recognising it, could not suppress a
cry of amazement.
</p>

<p>
He was not young, as I had supposed, but old
and decrepit.  The countenance was the ugly,
sinister one of Branca, the queer old fellow with
whom I had had such a strange interview in Leghorn
only a few days before.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
PRESENTS A CURIOUS PHASE
</h3>

<p>
This discovery increased the mystery.  Yet it was
plain that he was acting according to his promise,
and was leaving no effort untried in order to solve
the problem.  But why?  What possible interest
could he have in discovering the truth regarding
Reggie's assassination?
</p>

<p>
Certainly his appearance was greatly altered.
Instead of the unkempt, shuffling Italian whom I
had visited in the Via Magenta, in Leghorn, he was
spruce, well-shaven, and smartly dressed, although
his dwarfed and slightly deformed personality
could not be disguised.
</p>

<p>
The look upon his countenance was the reverse of
reassuring.  Ugly even when smiling, his face was
distorted by rage, and absolutely forbidding, as
he walked hurriedly past within half-a-dozen feet
of me, and away towards the exit from the garden.
The insult he had sustained was one which angered
him terribly, and if ever vengeance was written
upon a man's face it was written upon his.
</p>

<p>
The queer old fellow had puzzled me greatly ever
since that eventful evening at Leghorn.  To me
there was such an absence of motive that his actions
were doubly remarkable.  And yet I could never
get away from the fact that he knew of old Keppel's
intention to go to Ragusa before it had been
announced to us; and he was also well acquainted
with all the facts of poor Reggie's tragic end, and
the subsequent action on the part of both the
police and myself.  Besides, he had told me of
Ernest's whereabouts, of which I was in ignorance,
and now it appeared that he had been, until a
moment ago, on friendly terms with the woman
who had robbed me of the one man who in all the
world was dear to me.
</p>

<p>
Utterly dumbfounded by his presence there, I
watched him walk down the long gravelled path
beside the lake, past the landing-stage, and out
towards the public road.  Indeed, I think I was
too astonished at that moment to rise and follow
the man who had declared our interests to be
identical.
</p>

<p>
I turned and glanced across at the woman.  She
had risen, shaken out her skirts, and hastily drawn
her light cape about her shoulders, as for a moment
she stood in hesitation, looking after her companion.
</p>

<p>
Her brow was knit, and I seemed to watch
determination becoming more and more strongly
marked upon her face.  Then she hurried quickly
after him.
</p>

<p>
I rose, too, but a thought flashed across my mind.
He had not gathered up the fragments of the letter
before leaving.  They were, no doubt, still there.
What could the letter contain that it should so
incense her?
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation I moved across to the table
so lately occupied, and there saw scattered on the
ground in the vicinity several pieces of torn paper,
which I gathered swiftly into my hand.  They were
portions of a letter written on white-edged,
smoke-grey paper of a fashionable pattern.  Fortunately,
no waiters were in the near neighbourhood, and I
was enabled to continue my search, for any stray
scraps might, I reflected, be of importance.  After
I had picked up a piece that had been blown some
distance off, I placed all the fragments carefully in
my pocket, and made my way toward the brightly-lit
entrance.
</p>

<p>
As there were no cabs, I was compelled to walk
to the station, which occupied me quite a quarter
of an hour.  It appeared certain that both the man
and the woman would return to Paris, and that the
woman hoped to meet Branca at the railway-station.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived, however, I found that the train
had just departed for the Gare du Nord, and that
there was not another for nearly an hour.  If they
had both left by the train I had so narrowly missed,
then they had successfully escaped me.
</p>

<p>
The bare <i>salle d'attente</i> at Enghien is not a
cheerful place at night, when the single gas jet is
turned low, and the doors leading out upon the
platform are securely locked.  Here, again, I was
confronted by a difficulty, namely, that if,
perchance, the pair had not caught the train, they
would probably enter the waiting room.  To remain
there was manifestly dangerous, if I did not wish
my identity to be revealed.
</p>

<p>
My chief regret was that I had missed Branca.
I had no means of communicating with him, for I
had no idea where he was staying, and he certainly
did not know my address, or else he would have
sent me word that he was in Paris.  All I could
hope was that the woman had caught him up and
detained him, and that they would return together
by the next train.
</p>

<p>
Deciding that to rest in the waiting-room was
injudicious, I went out and crossed to the little café
opposite, where the tables on the pavement were
shaded by a row of laurels in tubs, in the usual
French style.  I wished to piece together the
precious letter in my pocket without being
observed.  I entered the place and sat down.  A
consumptive waiter and a fat woman presiding
over the bottles on the small counter were the only
occupants, and after ordering a "limonade," I
drew forth scrap after scrap of the torn letter and
spread it out upon the table.
</p>

<p>
It was written in French, in a feminine hand, but
it was some time before I could piece the fragments
together so as to read the whole.  At last I
succeeded, and discovered it to be dated from the
"Grand Hotel" at Brussels.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>My dear Laumont,&mdash;See Julie the instant she
returns from Moscow, and warn her.  Someone has
turned traitor.  Tell her to be extremely careful, and
to lie low for the present.  If she does not, she will
place us all in jeopardy.  Advise her to go to London.
She would be safe there.  So would you.  Bury
yourselves.&mdash;Hastily, your friend,</i> "SIDONIE."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Laumont!  Who, I wondered, was Laumont?
</p>

<p>
Was it possible that the woman referred to as
Julie was actually the person who had so fascinated
Ernest?  If so, the warning was a strange one;
and she had disregarded it by tearing up the letter
and casting it into Branca's face.
</p>

<p>
"Bury yourselves."  The injunction was
expressive, to say the least of it.  Some person
unknown had turned traitor, and had told the truth
regarding some matter which had apparently been
a secret.  The letter was a mysterious one, from
every point of view.
</p>

<p>
A dozen times I read it through, then carefully
collected the scraps and replaced them in my pocket.
</p>

<p>
The person to whom the letter was addressed was,
without doubt, an accomplice of the woman Julie,
while their correspondent, who was named Sidonie,
and who stayed at the "Grand Hotel" in Brussels,
was anxious that both should escape to London.
The woman Julie had been in Moscow.  Was it
possible that this woman who had attracted Ernest
had during my absence in the Mediterranean been
in Russia?  Perhaps she had.
</p>

<p>
Yet I had no ground whatever for believing
the woman whom I had seen at Monte Carlo, and
had so recently followed from Paris, to be named
Julie.  My suspicions might, for aught I knew, be
entirely groundless.
</p>

<p>
From where I sat I could watch all persons entering
the station, but my heart sank within me when
at length it was time for me to cross to take the
train for Paris, for my search along the platform
was a fruitless one.
</p>

<p>
Both had evidently left by the earlier train, and
the absence of a fiacre at the door of the Casino had
caused me to lose sight of them.
</p>

<p>
Alone in the dimly-lit railway compartment, as
the train passed through the suburb of St. Denis
and on to the Gare du Nord, I reflected deeply.
My brain was awhirl with the events which had
occurred so rapidly since landing at Leghorn.  I
knew not whether Captain Davis had received my
telegram and had left for Genoa, or whether the
message had been delayed until he had received
that package which was destined to send the
<i>Vispera</i> to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
On every side I saw plot and counterplot, the
most dastardly of them all being the determination
of Keppel to destroy his yacht.  And Ulrica?
What of her?  That she was on board was almost
certain; she might even then be sailing southward
to her doom.
</p>

<p>
Yet I had warned her, and I hoped that she had
come ashore as we had arranged.  The only possibility
I feared was a disinclination upon her part
to offend the old millionaire.  If she found the
course altered to Genoa, a change which I had
endeavoured to effect by my telegram, she might
possibly have gone on there.  All that I prayed for
was that my wire had reached Davis's hand before
the package supposed to contain the statuette.
</p>

<p>
Keppel at that moment no doubt believed the
<i>Vispera</i> to have gone down, and was prepared for
the receipt of the astounding news from one or
other of the Mediterranean ports.  Possibly he
believed that he had a perfect answer to the question
as to why he had left the vessel, but to me it seemed
as though he would meet with considerable difficulty,
if the worst had really happened.
</p>

<p>
There might, too, be a survivor, and a survivor's
testimony in such a case would be awkward.
</p>

<p>
As the train, with its <i>impériales</i>, or seats above
the third-class carriages, rushed on toward Paris,
I pondered, too, upon Branca's sudden reappearance.
There was something uncanny about the
fellow.  His knowledge was as extensive as his
cunning was low and ingenious.
</p>

<p>
For what reason, I wondered, had he met that
tow-haired woman who had been Ernest Cameron's
good genius at Monte Carlo?  Why, too, had she
taken the trouble to go out to Enghien for the
purpose of seeing him?
</p>

<p>
One theory alone took possession of my mind,
namely, that there was a secret between them.
Possibly he had been acquainted with her; they
might even have been friends.  But it was quite
evident that they had quarrelled, and he had been
gravely offended by the insult offered him.
</p>

<p>
Each night-train from Enghien to the Gare du
Nord always brought home a large number of
returning gamblers and pleasure-seekers, so when
we came to a standstill, the quai quickly became
crowded by persons whom I had noticed strolling
in the Casino.  In vain, however, I searched for
the pair whose movements I had been watching.
I was compelled to acknowledge myself baffled,
and to take a fiacre back to the "Hôtel Terminus."
</p>

<p>
Fearing lest any of the trio might be lounging at
the café in front of the hotel, where arriving cabs
file slowly past, I dismissed the vehicle at the
corner of the Rue du Havre, and approached the
hotel on the opposite side of the way.
</p>

<p>
One of my chief difficulties was the entering and
leaving the hotel, for I never knew whom I might
meet.  I had had several narrow escapes from
recognition, notwithstanding every possible precaution.
</p>

<p>
At last, however, after carefully examining all who
were lounging about the entrance, I managed to
slip in, passing the big-moustached <i>concierge</i>, and
ascending by the lift to my own room, utterly worn
out by anxiety and fatigue.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
GIVES THE KEY TO THE CIPHER
</h3>

<p>
Even though tired out, I slept but little that night.
I tried, times without number, but in vain, to solve
the secret of that cipher message&mdash;or warning,
was it?&mdash;written upon the table before the "Grand
Café."  But neither the initial nor the word "tabac"
conveyed to me any meaning whatever.  One fact
seemed particularly strange, namely, the reason
why the ragged collector of cigar-ends should have
searched for it; and, further, why the word written
there should have been "tabac."  Again, who was
the shabby, wizen-faced individual who had watched
that table with such eagerness and expectancy?
</p>

<p>
As I reflected, I became impressed by the idea
that the table itself was one of those known to be
a notice-board of criminals, and therefore at night
it was watched by the police.
</p>

<p>
The great Goron, that past-master in the detection
of crime, had, I remembered, told me that in all the
quarters of Paris, from the <i>chic</i> Avenue des Champs
Elysées to the lower parts of Montmartre, there
were certain tables at certain cafés used by thieves,
burglars, and other such gentry, for the exchange
of messages, the dissemination of news, and the
issue of warnings.  Indeed, the correspondence on
the café tables was found to be more rapid, far
more secret, and likely to attract less notice than
the insertion of paragraphs in the advertisement
columns of the newspapers.  Each gang of
malefactors had, he told me, its own particular table
in its own particular café, where any member could
sit and read at his leisure the cipher notice, or
warning, placed there, without risking direct
communication with his associates in rascality.
</p>

<p>
Had the man whom I had so fondly loved actually
allied himself with some criminal band, that he
knew their means of communication, and was in
possession of their cipher?  It certainly seemed
as though he had.  But that was one of the points
I intended to clear up before denouncing him to the
police.
</p>

<p>
Next morning I rose early, eager for activity,
but there seemed no movement in the room
adjoining mine.  All three took their coffee in their
bedrooms, and it was not till nearly eleven o'clock
that I heard Keppel in conversation with the
mysterious woman who had been my travelling
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Ernest is running a great risk," he was saying.
"It's quite unnecessary, to my mind.  The police
are everywhere on the alert, for word has, of course,
come from Nice.  If he is unfortunate enough to fall
into their hands, he'll only have himself to blame."
</p>

<p>
"But surely you don't anticipate such a thing?"
she asked, in genuine alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he goes about quite openly, well knowing
that his description has been circulated through
every town and village in France."
</p>

<p>
"And if he were arrested, where should he be?"
inquired the woman, in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"In a very awkward predicament, I fear," he
responded.  "That's the very reason why I'm
trying to persuade Cameron to act with greater
discretion.  He's well known, you see, and may be
recognised at any moment in the street.  If he
were a stranger here, in Paris, it might be different."
</p>

<p>
"It's certainly ridiculous for him to run his head
into a noose.  I must speak to him at once."
</p>

<p>
"He's out.  He went out before six this morning,
the chambermaid tells me."
</p>

<p>
"That's odd!  Where's he gone?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't exactly know.  Somewhere in the
country, I should think."
</p>

<p>
"What if he is already arrested?"
</p>

<p>
"No, don't let's anticipate such a <i>contretemps</i>.
Matters are, however, beginning to look serious
enough, in all conscience," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we shall succeed?" she inquired
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"We have been successful before," he responded
confidently.  "Why not now?  We have only to
exercise just a little more care and cunning than
that exercised by the police.  Then, once beyond
suspicion, all the rest is perfectly plain sailing."
</p>

<p>
"Which means that we must make a perfect <i>coup</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  The whole scheme must be carried
out firmly and without a hitch, otherwise we shall
find ourselves in very hot water."
</p>

<p>
"Knowing this should make us desperate," she
observed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm desperate already," he replied, in a quiet
voice.  "It will not go well with anyone who tries
to thwart us now.  It's a matter of life or death."
</p>

<p>
What new plot had been hatched I could not
guess.  What was this fresh conspiracy that was
intended?  His carefully-guarded words awoke in
me an intense curiosity.  I had already overheard
many things, and still resolved to possess myself in
patience, and to continue my ever-watchful vigil.
There was, according to the old man's own words, a
desperate plot in progress, which the conspirators
were determined to carry out at all hazards, even
up to the point of taking another human life.
</p>

<p>
I wrote down on a piece of paper the cipher which
I had found scrawled upon the table, and tried by
several means to reduce it to some intelligible
message, but without success.  It was evidently
in one of those secret codes used by criminals, and
therefore I had but a remote chance of discovering
a key to what so often had puzzled the cleverest
detectives of the sûreté.
</p>

<p>
The day passed without any important incident.
I remained in my room awaiting the return of the
man whose strange action had puzzled me on the
previous night, and who was now running such
risk of arrest.  If he returned, I hoped to overhear
his conversation with his companions; but
unfortunately he did not come back.  All was quiet in
the adjoining chamber, for Keppel and the woman
with the strange marks had evidently gone out in
company.
</p>

<p>
About seven o'clock I myself dressed and went
forth, strolling idly along until I stood on the
pavement at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens,
in front of the Opera.  There are always many
idlers there, mostly sharks on the watch for the
unsuspecting foreigner.  The English and American
tourist offices are just opposite, and from the corner
these polyglot swindlers can easily fix upon persons
who change cheques as likely victims, and track
them down.  Suddenly it occurred to me to stroll
along and glance at the table before the "Grand
Café."  This I did, but found only the remains of
some cipher which had been hastily obliterated,
possibly earlier in the day, for the surface of the
marble was quite dry, and only one or two faint
pencil-marks remained.
</p>

<p>
As I sat there, I chanced to glance across the road,
and to my surprise saw the same shabby, wizen-faced
man lounging along the kerb.  He was evidently
keeping that table under observation.  While
pretending not to see him, I drank my coffee, paid,
rose from my seat, and walked away; but as the
watcher at once followed me, I returned to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
It is not pleasant for a woman to be followed by a
strange man, especially if she is bent upon making
secret inquiries, or is watching another person, so
when I had again returned to my room I presently
bethought myself of the second exit from the
hotel&mdash;the one which leads straight into the
booking-office of the Gare St. Lazare.  By means of this
door I managed to escape the little man's vigilance,
and entering a cab, drove down to the Pont des Arts.
As I had nothing particular to do, it occurred to
me that if I could find the little <i>coiffeur's</i>, where I
had seen the man with whom I had danced on the
night of the Carnival ball, I might watch, and
perhaps learn something.  That this man was on
friendly terms with both Keppel and Cameron had
been proved by that scrap of confidential
conversation I had chanced to overhear.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty I experienced in recognising the
narrow and crooked street was considerable, but
after nearly an hour's search through the smaller
thoroughfares to the left of the Boulevard St. Michel,
my patience was rewarded, and I slowly passed the
little shop on the opposite side.  The place was in
darkness, apparently closed.  Scarcely had I passed,
however, when someone emerged from the place.
It was, I felt quite sure, the man who had worn the
owl's dress.  He was dressed rather elegantly, and
seemed to possess quite an air of distinction.
Indeed, no one meeting him in the street would have
believed him to be a barber.
</p>

<p>
Almost involuntarily, I followed him.  He lit a
cigarette, and then walked forward at a rapid pace
down the Boulevard, across the Pont Neuf, and
turning through many streets, which were as a
bewildering maze to me, he suddenly tossed his
cigarette away, entered a large house, and made some
inquiry of the <i>concierge</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Madame Fournereau?" I heard the old man
answer gruffly.  "Yes.  Second floor, on the left."
</p>

<p>
And the man who had so mysteriously returned to
me the stolen notes went forward, and up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Madame Fournereau!  I had never, as far as I
recollected, heard that name before.
</p>

<p>
I strolled along a little farther, hesitating whether
to remain there until the man emerged again, when,
as I lifted my eyes, I happened to see the name-plate
at the street corner.  It was the Rue du Bac.  In
an instant the similarity of the word in the cipher,
"tabac" occurred to me.  Could it be that the
woman for whom the message was intended lived
there?  Could it be that this woman for whose love
Ernest had forsaken me was named Fournereau?
I entertained a lively suspicion that I had at last
discovered her name and her abode.
</p>

<p>
I think at that moment my usual discretion left
me utterly.  So many and so strange were the
mysteries which had surrounded me during the
past month or so, that I believe my actions were
characterised by a boldness of which no woman in
her right senses would have been capable.  Now that
I reflect upon it all, I do not think I was in my right
senses that night, or I should not have dared to
act alone and unaided as I did.  But the determination
to avenge the poor lad's death, and at the same
time to avenge my own wrongs, was strong upon me.
A jealous woman is capable of breaking any of
the ten commandments.  "<i>Amor dà per mercede,
gelosia e rotta fede.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Had I remained to reason with myself, I should
never have entered that house, but fired by a
determination to seek the truth, and to meet that woman
face to face, I entered boldly and, without a word to
the <i>concierge</i>, passed up to the second floor.
</p>

<p>
The house was, I discovered, like many in Paris,
far more handsome within than without.  The
stairs leading to the flats were thickly carpeted
and were illuminated by electricity, though, judging
by the exterior, I had believed it to be a house
of quite a fourth-rate class.  When I rang at the
door on the left a neat Parisian <i>bonne</i> in a muslin
cap answered my summons.
</p>

<p>
"Madame Fournereau?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui</i>, madame," answered the woman, as she
admitted me to the narrow but well-furnished
entrance-hall.  "Madame is expecting you, I believe.
Will you please enter?"
</p>

<p>
I saw in an instant that I was mistaken for a
guest, and quickly made up my mind to use this
mistake to the best possible advantage.
</p>

<p>
My quick eyes noticed in the hall a number of
men's hats and women's capes.  From the room
beyond came quite a babel of voices.  I walked
forward in wonderment, but next second knew the
truth.  The place was a private gambling-house.
Madame's guests, a strange and motley crowd, came
there to play games of hazard.
</p>

<p>
In the room I had entered was a roulette table,
smaller than those at Monte Carlo, and around
it were some twenty well-dressed men and women,
all intent upon the game.  Notes and gold were lying
everywhere upon the numbers and the single
chances, and the fact that no silver was there was
sufficient testimony that high stakes were usual.
The air was close and oppressive, for the windows
were closed and heavily curtained, and above the
sound of excited voices rose that well-known cry
of the unhealthy-looking, pimply-faced croupier in
crimped shirt front and greasy black:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Messieurs, faites vos jeux!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Advancing to the table, I stood there unnoticed
in the crowd.  Those who saw me enter undoubtedly
believed me to be a gambler, like themselves, for it
appeared as though madame's guests were drawn
from various classes of society.  Although the
atmosphere was so stifling, I managed to remain
cool, and affected to be interested in the game by
tossing a louis upon the red.
</p>

<p>
I won.  It is strange that carelessness at roulette
invariably brings good fortune.  I glanced about me,
eager to discover madame herself, but saw neither
her nor the barber whom I had followed to this
place.  At the end of the room there were, however,
a pair of long sage-green curtains, and as one of
the players rose from the table and passed between
them, I saw that another gaming-room lay beyond,
and that the gamblers were playing baccarat, the
bank being held by a superior-looking old gentleman
who was wearing the crimson ribbon of the
Legion d'Honneur in the lapel of his dining-jacket.
</p>

<p>
Boldly I went forward into that room, and in an
instant saw that I was not mistaken, for there,
chatting to a circle of men and women at the opposite
end of the <i>salon</i>, was the small, fair-haired
woman whom I had seen in Ernest's company at
Monte Carlo, and whom I had followed to Enghien.
The man who had given me the stolen notes was
standing near her, listening to her account of a
pleasure trip from which she had apparently only
just returned.
</p>

<p>
A couple of new-comers, well-dressed men, entered,
walked straight up to her, shook hands, and
expressed their delight that she had returned to Paris
to resume her entertainments.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, am glad to return to all my friends,
messieurs," she laughed.  "I really found Monte
Carlo very dull, after all."
</p>

<p>
"You were not fortunate?  That is to be
regretted."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she said.  "With such a maximum, how
can one hope to gain?  It is impossible."
</p>

<p>
I stood watching the play.  As far as I could see,
it was perfectly fair; but some of the players,
keen-faced men, were evidently practised
card-sharpers, swindlers, or men who lived by their
wits.  The amount of money constantly changing
hands surprised me.  As I stood there, one young
man, scarcely more than a lad, lost five thousand
francs with perfect <i>sang-froid</i>.  The women present
were none of them young, but were mostly elderly
and ugly, of that stamp so eternally prominent in
the Principality of Monaco.  The woman, when she
turns gambler, always loses her personal beauty.
It may be the vitiated atmosphere in which she
exists; it may be the constant tension of the
nerves; or it may, perchance, be the unceasing,
all-consuming avarice&mdash;which, I know not.  All I
am certain of is that no woman can play and at the
same time remain fresh, youthful, and interesting.
</p>

<p>
Until that moment I had remained there unnoticed
in the excited crowd, for I had turned my back upon
Madame Fournereau, lest she should recognise in
me the woman whom Ernest had undoubtedly
pointed out to her either in the Rooms, in Giro's, or
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
But as I began to pass back to the adjoining
room, where I considered there would be less risk
of recognition, the green curtains suddenly opened,
and Ernest Cameron stood before me.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
PIECES TOGETHER THE PUZZLE
</h3>

<p>
I stepped back quickly, while he, with eyes fixed
upon that fair-haired woman, who seemed the centre
of a miniature court, failed to notice me.  Upon his
face was a dark, anxious look, an expression such
as I had never before seen upon his countenance.
Perhaps he was jealous of the attention shown by
that dozen or so of men who were chatting and
laughing with her.
</p>

<p>
Her appearance was scarcely that of the keeper of
an illicit gaming-house.  One would have expected
to find some fine, dashing, handsome woman, in a
striking gown, and with a profuse display of
jewellery.  On the contrary, she was quietly dressed
in a pretty, graceful gown of dove-grey cashmere,
the bodice cut low and trimmed with passementerie,
a frock which certainly well became her rather
tame style of beauty.  The only ornament was a
small half-moon of diamonds in her hair.
</p>

<p>
Ernest appeared to take in the situation at a
glance, and with his back turned to her stood
watching the baccarat, just as I had feigned to
watch it.  Through the great mirror before him,
however, he could note all her actions.  She was
laughing immoderately at some remark made by
one of her companions, and I noticed how Ernest's
face went pale with suppressed anger.  How
haggard, how thin, how blanched, nervous, and ill he
looked!  Usually so smart in attire, his dress
clothes seemed to hang upon him, his cravat was
carelessly tied, and in place of the diamond solitaire
I had bought at Tiffany's for him in the early days
of our acquaintance&mdash;which he had worn when we
met at Monte Carlo&mdash;there was only a plain pearl
stud, worth perhaps ten centimes.  Alas! he had
sadly changed.  His was, indeed, the figure of a
man haunted by the ever-present shadow of his
crime.
</p>

<p>
It was curious, I thought, that he did not
approach her; but the reason for this became plain
ere long.  I had returned to the adjoining room,
and was again watching the roulette, when suddenly
she brushed past me on her way out into the corridor,
into which several other rooms opened.  Suddenly
I heard his well-known voice utter her name
in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Julie!"
</p>

<p>
Julie!  The person mentioned in the letter of
warning which she had torn up at Enghien!
</p>

<p>
She stopped, and recognising him for the first time,
gasped:
</p>

<p>
"Ernest!  You here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he responded.  "I told you that we
should meet, and I have found you, you see.  I must
speak to you alone."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," she responded.  "To-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"No, to-night&mdash;now.  What I have to say admits
of no delay," and he strode resolutely at her side,
while she, her face betraying displeasure at the
encounter, unwillingly went forth into the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I heard her exclaim in impatience,
"what is it you have to say to me?  I thought
when we parted it was agreed we were not to meet
again."
</p>

<p>
"You hoped so, you mean," he answered hardly.
"Come into one of these rooms, where we may be
alone.  Someone may overhear if we remain
standing in this passage."
</p>

<p>
"Is what you want to say so strictly confidential,
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, "it is."  Then, with every
sign of reluctance and impatience, she opened a
door behind them, and they passed into what
appeared to be her own <i>petit salon</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again the fire of jealousy consumed me, and without
thought of the consequences of my act, I went
straightway to the door, and entering, faced them.
</p>

<p>
As I entered, Ernest turned quickly, then stood
rigid and amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Carmela!" he gasped.  "How came you here&mdash;to
this place?"
</p>

<p>
"How I came here matters not," I answered, in a
hard tone.  "It is sufficient for you to know that I
have entered here to demand an explanation from
you and this woman&mdash;your accomplice."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" cried his companion, in
her broken English.  "What do you mean by
accomplice?"
</p>

<p>
"I refer to the murder of Reginald Thorne," I
said, as quietly as I was able.
</p>

<p>
"The murder of Monsieur Thorne," repeated the
woman.  "And what have I to do, pray, with the
death of that gentleman, whoever he may be?"
</p>

<p>
Ernest glanced at me strangely, and then
addressed her in a firm voice.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p293"></a>
"The person who murdered him was none other
than yourself&mdash;Julie Fournereau."
</p>

<p>
I stood dumbfounded.  Was it possible that he
intended to endeavour to fix the guilt upon her,
even though I knew the truth by the words I had
overheard, which were paramount to an admission?
</p>

<p>
"What!" she shrieked, in fierce anger, speaking
in French.  "You have sought me here to charge
me with murder&mdash;to bring against me a false
accusation?  It is a lie!  You know that I am
innocent."
</p>

<p>
"That point, madame, must be decided by a
judge," he answered, with marvellous coolness.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  I don't understand!"
she exclaimed, with a slight quiver in her voice
which betrayed a sudden fear.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that during the months which have
elapsed since the murder of my friend Thorne, at
Nice, I have been engaged in tracing the assassin&mdash;or,
to put it plainly, in tracing you."
</p>

<p>
I stood there, utterly astounded.  If his words
were true, why had he been concealed on board the
<i>Vispera</i> in order to avoid arrest?
</p>

<p>
She laughed, instantly assuming an attitude of
defiance.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" she said.  "You bring me here into this
room to make this absurd and unfounded charge!
You dare not say it before my friends.  They
would thrash you as if you were a mongrel of the
streets!"
</p>

<p>
His cheeks were pale, but there was a fierce and
resolute expression upon his countenance.  The
woman whom I had believed he loved was, it
seemed, his bitterest enemy.
</p>

<p>
"I have not the slightest wish to bring upon
you any greater exposure or disgrace than that
which must inevitably come," he said coolly.
"For months I have been waiting for this
opportunity, and by means of the cipher fortunately
discovered your return.  I was then enabled to
give the police some highly interesting information."
</p>

<p>
"The police!" she gasped, her face instantly
blanched to the lips.  "You have told them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he responded, gazing steadily upon her,
"I have told them."
</p>

<p>
"Then let me pass," she said hoarsely, making
towards the door.
</p>

<p>
But in a moment he had barred her passage,
then raised a small whistle quickly to his lips, and
blew it shrilly.
</p>

<p>
"So this is your revenge!  I was warned of
this from Brussels!" she cried, turning upon him
with a murderous light in her eyes.  But almost
before the words had left her mouth there were
sounds of scuffling and shouting, a smashing of
glass, and loud imprecations.  The whistle had
raised the alarm, and the police had entered the
place, and were preventing the egress of the players.
</p>

<p>
Outside, in the corridor, there were several fierce
scrimmages, but next instant the door opened, and
there entered three detectives&mdash;of whom one was
the wizen-faced little man who had betrayed such an
interest in myself when at the Grand Café&mdash;accompanied
by old Mr. Keppel, and the woman who
had been my travelling companion in the <i>wagon-lit</i>.
Certainly the arrangements perfected by the
police in order that their raid upon the private
gaming establishment might be successful in all
respects had been elaborately prepared, for at the
signal given by Ernest the <i>coup</i> was instantaneously
effected, and the players, nearly all of whom were
persons known as criminals, fell back entrapped and
dismayed.
</p>

<p>
The old millionaire and his companion were just
as astounded to find me present as Ernest had been.
But there was no time at that exciting moment for
explanations.  The plan had apparently been
arranged for the arrest of the white-faced woman, who
now stood trembling before us.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you it's a lie!" she cried hoarsely.  "I
did not kill him."
</p>

<p>
But Ernest, turning to the shabby little man,
said:
</p>

<p>
"I demand the arrest of that woman, Julie
Fournereau, for the murder of Reginald Thorne at
the 'Grand Hotel,' in Nice."
</p>

<p>
"You know her?" inquired the detective.
"Have you evidence to justify the arrest?
</p>

<p>
"I have evidence that she committed the murder&mdash;that
the sixty thousand francs stolen from the
dead man's pockets were in her possession on the
following morning; and, further, that on the night
on which the murder was committed she was staying
under another name at the very hotel in which
Mr. Thorne was found dead."
</p>

<p>
"And the witnesses?"
</p>

<p>
"They are already in Paris, waiting to be called
to give evidence."
</p>

<p>
A dead silence fell for a few moments.  We each
looked at one another.
</p>

<p>
The wretched woman, who had suddenly been
denounced by the man with whom she had been so
friendly at Monte Carlo, was standing in the centre
of the room, swaying forward, supporting herself by
clutching the edge of the small table.  Her white lips
trembled, but no word escaped from them.  She
seemed rendered speechless by the suddenness of the
overwhelming charge.
</p>

<p>
The detective's voice broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Julie Fournereau," he said in French, advancing
a few steps towards her, "in the name of
the law I arrest you for the murder of Reginald
Thorne at Nice."
</p>

<p>
"I am innocent!" she cried hoarsely, her haggard
eyes glaring at us with a hunted look in them.  "I
tell you I am quite innocent!"
</p>

<p>
"Listen," said Ernest, in a firm tone, although
there was a slight catch in his voice, which showed
how greatly excited he was.  "The reasons which
have led me to this step are briefly these.  Last
December, while living here in Paris, I went south
to spend the winter at Monte Carlo.  I stayed at
the 'Metropole,' and amid the cosmopolitan crowd
there met the woman before you.  One day there
arrived at the same hotel, from Paris, my friend
Reginald Thorne, whom I knew well in London, but
who had lived in Paris for the past year.  We were
about together during the day, and in the Rooms
that evening he encountered me walking beside this
woman Fournereau.  That same night he came
to my room, and in confidence related to me a
story which at the moment I regarded as somewhat
exaggerated, namely, that he had been induced to
frequent a certain gaming-house in Paris, where he
had lost almost everything he possessed, and how
he had ultimately discovered that an elaborate
system of sharping had been practised upon him
by the woman and her male accomplices.  That
woman, he told me, had left Paris suddenly just
at the moment when he discovered the truth, and
he had encountered her in the Rooms with me.
Her name was Julie Fournereau."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the wretched woman before us.  Her
wild eyes were fixed upon the carpet; her fingers
were twitching with intense agitation; her breath
came and went in short quick gasps.  Ernest, in
his exposure, was merciless.
</p>

<p>
"Had she seen him in the Rooms?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "We had come face to
face.  He told me that, as he had been robbed of
nearly all he possessed, he was determined to give
information against her.  She was, he told me, an
associate of bad characters in Paris, and urged me
to cut her acquaintance.  His story was strange
and rather romantic, for he gave me to understand
that this woman had made a pretence of loving him,
and had induced him to play in her house, with
the result that he lost large sums to a certain
man who was her accomplice.  Personally, I was not
very much charmed with her," Ernest went on,
glancing at me.  "She was evidently, as Thorne
had declared, acquainted with many of the worst
characters who frequent Monte Carlo, and I began
to think seriously that my own reputation would be
besmirched by being seen constantly in her
company.  Still, I tried to dissuade my friend from
endeavouring to wreak justice upon such a person,
arguing that, as he had lost the money in a private
gaming establishment, he had no remedy in law.
But he was young and headstrong&mdash;possibly suffering
from a fit of jealousy.  After several days,
however, fearing that he might create a scene with
this notorious woman, I at last induced him to go
over to Nice and stay at the 'Grand.'  While there,
curiously enough, he met the lady who is here
present, Miss Rosselli, and at once fell deeply in
love with her."
</p>

<p>
"No," I protested, in quick indignation, "there
was no love whatever between us.  That I strongly
deny."
</p>

<p>
"Carmela," he said, bestowing on me a calm and
serious look.  "In this affair I must speak plainly
and openly.  I myself have a confession to make."
</p>

<p>
"Of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, and I'll explain everything."  Then
turning to the others, he went on: "Reginald fell
violently in love with Miss Rosselli, not knowing
that she had been engaged to become my wife.
When, the day after meeting her at the hotel, he
told me of his infatuation, and heard from me the
whole truth, he seemed considerably upset.  'She
loves you still,' he said.  'I feel certain that she
does, for she has given me no encouragement.'  I
affected to take no notice of his words, but to me
the matter was a very painful one.  I had broken
off the engagement, it was true, but my heart was
now filled by bitter remorse.  I had seen Carmela
again; all the old love had come back to me, and
I now despised myself for my mean and unwarrantable
action.  We had met several times, but
as strangers; and knowing her proud spirit, I
feared to approach her, feeling certain that she
would never forgive."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive!" I cried.  "I would have gladly
forgiven!"
</p>

<p>
"Carmela," he said, turning again to me with a
very serious expression on his face, "I regret being
compelled to lay bare my secret thus before you,
but I must tell them everything."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  "Now that this woman is to
bear the punishment of her crime, let us know
all."  Then I added bitterly: "Speak without
any regard for my feelings, or even for my
presence."
</p>

<p>
"A few days prior to his tragic end, poor Reggie
had, as I have explained, moved over to the 'Grand'
at Nice, but strangely enough, the same idea had
occurred to this woman Fournereau.  She preferred
to live in Nice during Carnival, she told me,
for she liked all the fun and gaiety.  Whether it
was for that reason, I know not, but at all events it
seems clear, from inquiries recently completed in
Nice, that one afternoon he met this woman at
Rumpelmayer's, the fashionable lounge for afternoon
tea, and in a sudden fit of anger declared that
he would denounce her as an adventuress and
swindler.  Now it appears that his clients, the
gamblers who frequent this place, number among
them some of the most notorious and desperate members
of the criminal fraternity, and the natural
conclusion is that, fearing his exposure, she killed him."
</p>

<p>
"I deny it!" cried the wretched woman.  "It
is a false accusation, which you cannot prove."
</p>

<p>
"The extreme care and marvellous ingenuity by
which the poor fellow's death was encompassed is
shown by every detail of the case.  Not a single
point was apparently overlooked.  Even the means
by which he was assassinated have remained, until
now, a mystery.  But passing to the night of the
tragedy, it will be remembered that he had won
sixty thousand francs at roulette, and having left
Miss Rosselli and her friends, he re-entered the
Rooms and changed his winnings into large notes.
Half an hour before, this woman, whom I had met
earlier in the evening, and who had dined with me
at Giro's, had wished me good-night.  She had
previously watched his success at the tables, and
had followed him into the Casino when he re-entered
to change the notes.  The interval of about an hour
between his leaving Monte Carlo and his arrival
at the 'Grand Hotel' at Nice is still unaccounted
for.  Nevertheless, we know that this woman,
whom he had threatened, travelled by the same
train from Monte Carlo to Nice, that she entered
the hotel a few minutes later and went to her room,
and that next morning she had in her possession
sixty notes, each for a thousand francs.  It seems,
however, that she quickly became alarmed lest
suspicion might rest upon her, for the police had
commenced active inquiries, and therefore she
resolved to get rid of the stolen notes.  This she
did with the aid of an accomplice, a man named
Vauquelin&mdash;a man very well known at Monte
Carlo.  This rascal, one of the <i>habitués</i> of this place,
went to the Carnival ball at the Nice Casino, and
there gave Miss Rosselli the stolen money, intending
that its possession should throw suspicion upon
her.  Some other members of that interesting gang
of sharpers, who make this place their headquarters,
going south in winter in search of pigeons to pluck,
knowing Vauquelin's intention, posed as detectives,
to whom Miss Rosselli innocently handed over the
notes she had received."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment; then he continued:
"Now, however, comes one of the most ingenious
features of the affair.  This woman, finding next day
that her plot to throw suspicion upon Miss Rosselli
had failed, turned her attention to myself.  She
was aware that a slight quarrel had occurred between
Reggie and myself regarding his injudicious and
futile action in seeking to denounce her, and,
with others, had overheard some high words
between us when we had met on the terrace at the
Café de Paris on the afternoon previous to his
death.  She gave information to the police, and
then left the Riviera suddenly.  Next day I found
myself under the observation of the police, and in
order to escape arrest, induced Mr. Keppel&mdash;who
has taken a great interest in the affair from the
first, being one of the trustees under the will of
Mr. Thorne, senior&mdash;to conceal me on board his yacht
until such time as our inquiries in Paris could be
completed.  It was ascertained that this woman
Fournereau, who had gone to Russia, intended to
return to her apartment here upon a date she had
arranged with one of her accomplices, a Corsican
named Laumont.  This is the reason why it seemed
good to me to remain in hiding from the police
until to-day.  This is her first reception, notice
of which was circulated among her friends by means
of the cipher upon certain tables in the cafés on
the <i>grands boulevards</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Then you, too, were actually concealed on
board the <i>Vispera</i> during the whole cruise?" I
exclaimed, in great surprise.
</p>

<p>
"No, I went ashore at Malta, and the vessel
returned for me three weeks later," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"But this lady?" I inquired, indicating the
handsome woman who had been my travelling
companion in the <i>wagon-</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I am the mother of Reginald Thorne," she
herself explained.
</p>

<p>
"You!  Reggie's mother!" I cried, scarcely
able to believe her words.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered.  "I was spending the
winter in Cairo.  Hearing of my poor son's death, I
crossed from Alexandria, and arrived in Nice, only
to find that the <i>Vispera</i> had sailed.  A letter was
awaiting me with full explanations, asking me to
travel to Malta, and there join the yacht.  This
I did; but in order that my presence should not be
known to those on board, I was placed secretly in
the deck-cabin, and never left it.  The blow that
had fallen upon me on hearing of poor Reggie's
death, combined with the constant imprisonment
in that cabin, I believe upset the balance of my
mind, for one night&mdash;the night before we put into
Leghorn&mdash;I became unconscious.  I was subject to
strange hallucinations, and that night experienced
a sensation as though someone was attempting to
take my life by strangulation."
</p>

<p>
"I must explain," said old Mr. Keppel, addressing
her.  "It is only right that you should now know
the truth.  On the night in question you were
unusually restless, and becoming seized by a fit of
hysteria, commenced to shout and shriek all sorts of
wild words regarding your poor son's murder.  Now
I had concealed you there, and fearing lest some of
the guests should hear you, and that a scandal might
be created, I tried to silence you.  You fought me
tooth and nail, for I verily believe that the close
confinement had driven you insane.  In the struggle I
had my hands over your mouth, and afterwards
pressed your throat in order to prevent your
hysterical shrieks, when suddenly I saw blood upon your
lips, and the awful truth dawned upon me that I had
killed you by strangulation.  Tewson, the chief
steward&mdash;who, with the exception of Cameron, was
the only person on board who knew of your
presence&mdash;chancing to enter at that moment, made the
diabolical suggestion that in order to get rid of the
evidence of my crime I should allow him to blow up the
ship.  This I refused, and fortunately, half an hour
later, I succeeded in restoring you to consciousness.
Then we landed at Leghorn on the following evening,
not, however, before I discovered that the real motive
of Tewson's suggestion was that he had stolen nearly
three thousand pounds in cash, notes, and securities
from a box in Lord Stoneborough's cabin, and wished
to destroy the ship so that his crime might thus be
concealed.  The man, I have discovered, has a very
bad record, and has now disappeared.  But time
was pressing, so we all three left Leghorn for Paris,
and I gave orders to Davis to take the yacht into the
Adriatic, where I intended to rejoin it."
</p>

<p>
Then, briefly, I explained what I had seen and
overheard on that wild, boisterous night in the
Mediterranean; how I had followed the millionaire
and the woman who was bent upon avenging the
murder of her son; how I had sent the yacht on to
Genoa, and how carefully I had watched the movements
of all three during those days in Paris.  All
seemed amazed by my story&mdash;Ernest most of all.
</p>

<p>
"During that night in the <i>wagon-lit</i>," I said,
addressing Mrs. Thorne, "I noticed two curious
marks upon your neck.  Upon your poor son's neck
were similar marks."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she replied; "they were birth-marks&mdash;known
as the marks of thumb and finger.  Poor
Reggie bore them exactly as I do."
</p>

<p>
"And the woman who murdered him, and who so
ingeniously attempted first to fasten the guilt upon
Miss Rosselli, and then afterwards upon myself, is
there!" cried Ernest, pointing at the trembling,
pallid woman before us.  "She killed him, because
she feared the revelations he could make to the
police regarding the place in which we are standing."
</p>

<p>
The woman Fournereau raised her head at Ernest's
denunciation, and laughed a strange, harsh laugh of
defiance.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bien!</i>" she cried shrilly, with affected carelessness.
"Arrest me, if you will!  But I tell you that
you are mistaken.  You have been clever&mdash;very
clever, all of you; but the assassin was not myself."
</p>

<p>
The police-officer now spoke to her:
</p>

<p>
"Then if you yourself are not guilty, you are
aware of the identity of the murderer.  Therefore I
shall arrest you as being an accomplice.  It is the
same."
</p>

<p>
"No; I was not even an accomplice," she protested
quickly.  "I may be owner of this place; I
may be a&mdash;a person known to you; but I swear I
have never been a murderess."
</p>

<p>
The officer smiled dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"The decision upon that point must be left to the
judges," he answered.  "There is evidence against
you.  For the present that is sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Cameron has told you that I was
threatened with exposure by the young Englishman,"
she said.  "That is perfectly true.  Indeed,
all that has been said is the truth&mdash;save one thing.
Neither did I commit the murder, nor had I any
knowledge of it until afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"But the stolen notes were actually in your
possession on the following morning," the detective
observed in a tone of doubt.
</p>

<p>
"They were given to me for safe keeping."
</p>

<p>
"By whom?"
</p>

<p>
"I refuse to say."
</p>

<p>
The detective shrugged his shoulders, and smiles
passed across the faces of his two companions.
</p>

<p>
"You prefer arrest, then?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I prefer to keep my own counsel," she answered.
"These persons," she continued, indicating us,
"have believed themselves extremely ingenious,
apparently taking upon themselves the duties of the
police, and have arrived at quite a wrong conclusion.
You may arrest me if you wish.  I have nothing
whatever to fear."
</p>

<p>
And she glanced around at us in open defiance.
Indeed, so indifferent was she, that I felt convinced
Ernest's theory of the committal of the crime had
fallen to the ground.
</p>

<p>
The detective seemed, however, well aware of the
woman's character, and proceeded to deal with her
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
"You are charged with the murder," he said.
"It is for you to prove your innocence."
</p>

<p>
"Who, pray, is the witness against me?" she
demanded indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Your accomplice!" cried Ernest quickly.  "The
man Laumont."
</p>

<p>
"Laumont!" she cried.  "He&mdash;he has told you
that I committed the crime; he has denounced me
as the murderess?"
</p>

<p>
"He has," answered Ernest.  "On that fatal
night when poor Thorne entered the Rooms to
change the notes I met him, and although we had had
a few high words in the Café de Paris on the previous
day, he approached me, asking my pardon, which
I readily gave.  He then inquired whether it was
really true that Miss Rosselli had been engaged to
me.  I replied in the affirmative, and he then said
that he did not intend to meet her again, but should
leave for Paris in the morning.  I tried to dissuade
him, but his only reply was: 'She loves you still,
my dear fellow.  She can never forget you; of that
I'm certain.'  Then he left, and travelled to Nice
without saying a single word to her.  Arrived at the
hotel, he went straight to her sitting-room and sat
down to write her a letter of farewell.  He
commenced one, but destroyed it.  This was afterwards
found in the room.  Then, just as he was about to
commence a second letter, you&mdash;you, Julie Fournereau,
entered, killed him, and stole the notes which
you knew he carried in his pockets!"
</p>

<p>
"How did I kill him?" she demanded, her eyes
flashing with anger.
</p>

<p>
"You yourself know that best."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  And Jean Laumont told you this elaborate
piece of fiction, did he?  It is amusing&mdash;very
amusing!"
</p>

<p>
At a word from the chief detective, one of the
officers left the room.  We heard Laumont's name
shouted loudly in the corridor, and a few minutes
later he was ushered in by two officers.
</p>

<p>
I stood rooted to the spot at sight of him.  The
man was none other than Branca, the queer old
fellow who had represented to me in Leghorn that
our interests were identical.  I saw how ingenious
had been his actions, and how deeply-laid his plot.
He had intended that I should sail to the Adriatic
after he had obtained from me all the information
I had collected.
</p>

<p>
On seeing us, he drew back in quick surprise, but
in an instant the woman flew at him in fury.
</p>

<p>
"You have told them!" she shrieked.  "You
have led them to believe that I murdered the
Englishman at Nice; you have declared that it was I
who gave you the notes; I who killed him!  You
white-livered cur!"
</p>

<p>
His ugly countenance fell.  Indignation had, in an
instant, given place to fear.  His sinister face was
full of evil.
</p>

<p>
"And did you not give me the notes?" inquired
the dwarfed man, now well dressed, and presenting
a very different appearance from that he had shown
at Leghorn.  He had evidently been playing
baccarat.  "Why, there are at least two men in
yonder room who were present when you handed
them to me."
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny that," she answered.  "I deny
that I killed him."
</p>

<p>
"Then who did?"
</p>

<p>
"Who did?" she shrieked.  "Who did?  <i>Why,
you yourself!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You lie!" he cried fiercely, his cheeks in an
instant ashen pale.
</p>

<p>
"I would have told them nothing," she went on
quickly.  "I would have allowed them to arrest me
and afterwards discover their mistake, were it not
that you had endeavoured to give me into their hands
in order to save yourself.  No, my dear friend, Julie
Fournereau is loyal only to those who are loyal to
her, as many have before found out to their cost.  I
would have saved you had you not led the police here
to raid my house, to arrest my friends, and to hurry
me away to prison for a crime that I did not commit.
But listen!  You deny the murder of the young
Englishman.  Well, shall I relate to them all that
occurred?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell them what untruths you like," he growled
fiercely.  "You cannot harm me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame," urged old Mr. Keppel, "tell
us all that you know.  We are determined now to
get to the bottom of this affair."
</p>

<p>
"This man," she explained, "was the man who
fleeced the unfortunate gentleman here in my house.
I am not wishing to shield myself for a single moment&mdash;I
desire only to tell the truth.  Monsieur Thorne,
when they last met here, accused him of cheating
at baccarat; high words ensued, and the young
man drew a revolver and fired, the bullet striking
Laumont in the shoulder, whereupon he swore to be
avenged.  I knew well that a vow of vengeance
taken by such a desperate character as Laumont was
something more than mere idle words; and when he
went to the Riviera, as he did each year, in search of
inexperienced youths whom he could fleece, I shortly
afterwards followed.  He stayed first at the 'Hôtel
de Paris' at Monte Carlo, but meeting young Thorne
accidentally one afternoon, he discovered that the
latter was living at the 'Grand' at Nice, and that
same night transferred his quarters there.  Now,
Thorne had an intimate friend at Nice&mdash;Mr. Gerald
Keppel&mdash;and it seemed as though Laumont desired
to make the latter's acquaintance, with the ulterior
motive of practising his sharper's tricks upon him.
Be that as it may, I, in order to watch the progress
of events, moved to the same hotel at Nice.  I knew
that Laumont was bent on vengeance, and felt
certain that some terrible <i>dénouement</i> was imminent."
</p>

<p>
She paused, and glanced around at us.  Then
lowering her eyes, she went on:
</p>

<p>
"I am an adventuress, it is true; but I have still
a woman's heart.  I was determined, if possible, to
prevent Laumont from wreaking vengeance upon
the poor boy.  It was for that reason I followed
him to Nice and took up my abode there.  On the
day of the tragedy I was in the Rooms at Monte
Carlo in the afternoon, and there saw him playing
and winning; while just as he was leaving with Miss
Rosselli, young Mr. Keppel and another lady, his
pockets bulging with his gains, I saw Jean Laumont
watching him.  By the evil look he cast in his
direction, I knew that the spirit of murder was in his
heart.  That evening I dined at Giro's with
Monsieur Cameron, and afterwards left him in order to
watch the movements of Jean and the young
Englishman.  The latter, after a short conversation with
Monsieur Cameron in the hall of the Casino,
descended by the lift to the station, and took train to
Nice.  I travelled by the same train, but in the
crowd at Nice station I lost sight of him.  He must
have taken a fiacre immediately to the hotel, and
furthermore, the Corsican must also have followed
him, without knowing of my presence.  I met some
friends at the station, but on arrival at the hotel,
twenty minutes later, I went straight up to my room.
On the way I had to pass the door of Miss Rosselli's
sitting-room, and just as I was approaching, my feet
falling softly on the thick carpet of the corridor, the
door opened noiselessly, and a man, after looking
forth stealthily, came out and stole along to the room
he occupied.  That man was Jean Laumont."
</p>

<p>
"You saw him?" cried Ernest.  "You actually
saw him coming from the room?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Instantly, I suspected something wrong,
and wondered for what purpose he had been in the
ladies' sitting-room.  Therefore, without hesitation,
I pushed open the door and looked inside.  Imagine
my surprise when I found the unfortunate man
writhing in agony upon the ground.  I knelt by him,
but recognising me as the woman at whose house he
had been cheated, he shrank from me.  'That man!'
he gasped with difficulty.  'That man has killed
me!' and a few moments later his limbs straightened
themselves out in a final paroxysm of agony, and he
passed away."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Thorne burst into a flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
The tow-haired woman was silent for a moment,
her eyes fixed upon the face of the man against whom
she had uttered that terrible denunciation.
</p>

<p>
"I stood there terrified&mdash;unable to move," she
went on.  "Laumont had, as I anticipated, killed
him."
</p>

<p>
"Killed him?  How can you prove it?" demanded
the cunning card-sharper, Vauquelin, who
had tricked me so cleverly, and who, in order to
throw the police off the scent, pursued the harmless
calling of hairdresser in that back street off the
Boulevard St. Michel.  Apparently he was the
Corsican's champion.  "How can you prove that
Jean Laumont killed him?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
REVEALS THE TRUTH
</h3>

<p>
The woman Fournereau crossed the room quickly
to a small rosewood bureau, and took therefrom a
little cardboard box about a couple of inches square,
such as is often used for containing cheap jewellery.
</p>

<p>
"I have something here," she said, addressing
the man before her, "which was lying on the floor.
You alone know its secret&mdash;a secret which I, too,
have lately discovered."
</p>

<p>
And opening the box carefully, she displayed,
lying in a bed of cotton-wool, what at first appeared
to be a woman's steel thimble.  Taking it from its
hiding-place, and placing it upon the forefinger of
her right hand, we saw that, instead of being what it
at first appeared, it rose to a sharply-tempered steel
point, about half an inch long, protruding from the
finger-tip.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the man accused.  His face had
blanched to the lips at sight of it.
</p>

<p>
"This," she explained, "I discovered on the floor
close to where the dead man was lying.  It is a
diabolical invention of Laumont's, which he showed me
a year ago, although he did not then explain its use.
An examination which has been made by my friend,
a chemist, has plainly indicated the truth.  You will
notice that the point is fine as a needle, but is hollow,
like that of a hypodermic syringe.  Within, at the
point touched by the tip of the finger, is a small
chamber filled with a most subtle and deadly
poison, extracted from a small lizard peculiar to
the Bambara country on the banks of the Upper
Niger."
</p>

<p>
The point would, I saw, act just as the fang of a
snake, for the thimble, when placed on the finger
and pressed against the flesh of the victim, would
inject the poison into the blood, causing almost
instantaneous collapse and death.  The puncture
made by such a fine point would be indistinguishable,
and the action of the poison, as we afterwards
learnt, so similar to several natural complications
that at the post-mortem examination doctors would
fail to distinguish the real cause of death.
</p>

<p>
She held the diabolical thimble out for us to
examine, saying:
</p>

<p>
"The mode in which this was used upon the
unfortunate Monsieur Thorne was undoubtedly
as follows:&mdash;He had seated himself at the table
with his back to the door when the Corsican,
Laumont, watching his opportunity, crept in with the
thimble upon his finger.  Before his victim was
aware of his presence he had seized him by the
collar from behind and pressed the point deep
into the flesh behind the right ear, at a spot where
the poison would at once enter the circulation.
You will remember that the doctors discovered
a slight scratch behind the ear, which they guessed
to be the only mark resulting from the struggle
which they believed had taken place.  But there
was no struggle.  As has been proved by the person
who examined for me this most deadly but
inoffensive-looking weapon, anyone struck by it
would become paralysed almost instantly.  Plainly,
then, the chair was broken by him as he fell against
it in fatal collapse."
</p>

<p>
"And the stolen notes?  What of them?"
asked Mr. Keppel anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she answered.  "Those accursed notes!
On the following morning Laumont came to me
and handed me the money, saying that as I knew
the truth regarding the crime, he would trust me
further, and give the money into my safe keeping.
I took it, for, truth to tell, I knew that he could
make some very unwelcome revelations to the
police regarding this place and the character of the
play here.  Therefore I decided that, after all,
silence was best, even though I held in my possession
the thimble which, I presume, in his hurry to
escape from the room, fell upon the floor and rolled
away.  I took the notes, and for some days kept
them; but finding that the police were making
such active inquiries, I returned them to him, and
he then resolved upon giving them to Miss Rosselli,
through one of his accomplices, either in order
further to baffle the detectives or else to throw
suspicion upon her.  She was told some extraordinary
story about a meeting in London, merely, of
course, to put the police off the scent, and cause
them to believe that the money was stolen by
English thieves.  Soon afterwards I knew that
Monsieur Cameron was aware of the manner in
which his friend had been cheated here.  This
caused me, from fear of being arrested on suspicion,
to fly to Russia, arranging with my friends to return
here on the 1st of May&mdash;to-day."
</p>

<p>
"The date of your return I learnt from Laumont
himself," explained Ernest, "for, in the course of
the inquiries I made immediately after the tragic
affair, I found that he was your intimate associate,
and in order to divert suspicion from himself he
hinted at you being the assassin."
</p>

<p>
"He denounced me, not knowing that I held the
actual evidence of his guilt in my hand," she cried,
holding out the finger with the curious-looking
thimble upon it.  "Poor Monsieur Thorne is, I
fear, not the first victim who has fallen beneath
the prick of this deadly instrument."
</p>

<p>
"To whom do you refer?" inquired the detective
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"To Monsieur Everton, the young Englishman
who was found dead about a year ago in the Avenue
des Acacias."
</p>

<p>
In an instant the man whom I had known in
Leghorn as Branca sprang at her with all the fury
of a wild beast, and, clutching her at the throat,
tried to strangle her.  His eyes were lit by the
fierce light of uncontrollable anger, his bushy hair
giving his white face a wild and terrible look, and
it really seemed that before the detectives could
throw themselves upon him, the murderer would
tear limb from limb the woman who had confessed.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the detectives and the man and
woman were all struggling wildly together.  Suddenly
a loud yell of pain escaped from the wretched
Corsican, and releasing his hold, he drew back,
with his left hand clasped upon his wrist.
</p>

<p>
He staggered, swayed unevenly, uttering terrible
imprecations.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dieu!</i>" he gasped.  "<i>You&mdash;you've killed me!</i>"
</p>

<p>
What had happened was easy to understand.
In the struggle the point of his cunning invention,
which was still upon the woman's finger, had
entered deeply the fleshy part of his wrist, injecting
that poison that was so swift, and for which no
antidote had ever been discovered.
</p>

<p>
As he staggered, two detectives sprang forward
to seize him, but before they could do so, he reeled,
clutched at the air, and fell heavily backward,
overturning a small table beside which he had been
standing.
</p>

<p>
Never was there a scene more ghastly.  I shall
remember every detail of it so long as I have power
to draw my breath.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, the wretched man who had
thus brought card-sharping and murder to a fine
art had breathed his last in frightful agony, his
ignominious career ended by his own diabolical
invention.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
CONTAINS THE CONCLUSION
</h3>

<p>
My reader, I have throughout been perfectly frank
with you&mdash;too frank, perhaps.  But need I dwell
further upon the stirring events of that night?
It is assuredly sufficient to say that the persons
arrested by the police numbered nearly forty, all
of whom were charged with various offences, in
addition to that of being found in an illicit
gaming-house.  Many of them, old offenders and desperate
characters, notwithstanding the fact that they were
outwardly respectable members of society, in due
course received long periods of imprisonment,
Vauquelin receiving a sentence of seven years.  But
Julie Fournereau, in view of the information she
had given regarding poor Reggie's death, was
dismissed with a fine of two thousand francs for
carrying on the house in question.  She has since
disappeared into obscurity.  Ulrica arrived in Paris
next morning from Genoa, and was absolutely
dumbfounded when we related the whole of the
amazing story.  That day, too, proved the happiest
in all my life.  Need I relate how, on the following
morning, Ernest sought me and begged me to
forgive?  Or how, with tears of joy, I allowed him
to hold me once more in his manly arms, as of old,
and shower fervent kisses upon my face?  No.
If I were to begin to relate the joys that had now
come to me, I should far exceed the space of a single
volume.  It is enough that you, reader, to whom I
have made confession, should know that within a
fortnight we all returned to London, and that while
Ulrica became engaged to Gerald, and soon afterwards
married him, with the old man's heartiest
approval, Ernest again asked me to become his
wife.
</p>

<p>
At Kensington Church, amid great <i>éclat</i>, within
a month of our arrival back in town, my happiness
broke into full flower.
</p>

<p>
Ulrica tells me, in the privacy of her little blue
boudoir in Eaton Square, that she is no longer
world-weary, living only for excitement, as in the
fevered days gone by, but that her life is full of a
peaceful happiness that cannot be surpassed.
Nevertheless, I cannot really bring myself to
believe that she is any happier than I am with
Ernest in our pretty home at Hyde Park Gate, for
the estrangement has rendered him all the more
dear to me, and we are indeed supremely content
in each other's perfect love.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Thorne, poor Reggie's mother, has returned
to Hampshire, fully satisfied at having cleared up
the mystery surrounding her son's tragic death;
while old Benjamin Keppel, late of Johannesburg,
and now of Park Lane and Ulverton Towers, in
Hertfordshire, still spends his winters in rather
lonely grandeur in his great villa amid the palms
outside Nice, working in secret at his ivory-turning,
and giving at intervals those princely entertainments
for which he has become so famous in the
cosmopolitan society which suns itself upon the
Riviera.
</p>

<p>
As for Ernest and myself, we have not visited
Nice since.  We prefer Cairo for the winter, with
a trip up to Luxor and Assouan, for we retain a
far too vivid recollection of those dark days of
doubt, desperation and despair, when it was our
strange and tragic lot to be so darkly associated
with The Gamblers.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
